=13. RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN=
==13.1 Introduction==
SurveiRams is a mobile application designed to develop a centralized system for Asia Pacific College’s (APC) Information Technology Resources Office (ITRO), Management Office (BMO), and Security Office. The application will assist them in managing incident reports and logs as well as provide insights.

The Risk Management Plan is important for projects following the Agile Methodology to use as a guide on how to identify and respond to risks. The team must enumerate potential risks, plan for responses, and monitor and control said risks from the project’s start to finish. Upon completion, the plan will be used every day, and may be revised to fit the project’s needs better, thus ensuring that the objectives of the project are achieved on time within budget.

Contents of this document include a summary of the risk management process, describing the sequence of steps as well as who is assigned to do so. Next is a guide for what constitutes as a risk and their hierarchy. Followed by this is the monitoring and controlling process for the risks, and last is the risk register.
   
To further develop a risk management plan for the SurveiRams System, the following information should be considered:   
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>'''Identifying and Assessing Risks'''</td>
      <td>The teams must enumerate potential risks to all phases of the project, such as technical issues, company policies, cybersecurity, time constraint, and human factors. These should then be assessed by the probability of their occurrence, as well as the scale of impact they may have.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>'''Risk Mitigation Strategies'''</td>
      <td>After identifying and assessing risks, the project team should develop a plan for mitigating or avoiding the risks. Mitigation strategies should be prioritized based on their effectiveness in reducing risk and their feasibility in terms of time and cost. Strategies may include contingency planning, redundancy, and the development of fallback procedures.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>'''Contingency Planning'''</td>
      <td>The project team should develop contingency plans for significant risks that could significantly impact the project's success. Contingency plans should outline the steps required to minimize the impact of the risk and maintain the project's progress. These plans should be regularly reviewed and updated as the project progresses, and new risks are identified.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>'''Communication and Reporting'''</td>
      <td>The project team should establish a clear communication and reporting framework for risk management. This framework should ensure that risks are regularly reviewed, and the project team is updated on any changes to the risk landscape. Communication should occur between project managers, team members, and stakeholders.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>'''Risk Monitoring and Review'''</td>
      <td>Risk management is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and review. The project team should establish a regular review process to ensure that risk management strategies remain effective, risks are updated, and new risks are identified. The review process should be transparent, with all stakeholders being updated on any changes.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
By considering these additional factors in a risk management plan, the SurveiRams System project team can ensure that the project is completed successfully, meeting all objectives while minimizing potential risks.   

==13.2 Top Three Risks==
Every project has risks whether foreseen or not. However, in the situation of the SurveiRams project, the three biggest foreseen risks are the following:
# '''Technical Risks''' – Risks that are brought by evolving technology, such as failure from either or both software and hardware and cyberattacks resulting in data loss and/or security breaches.
# '''Insufficient Resources''' – Risks that are brought by the lack of project resources such as exceeding the project timeline or going over budget, which may delay the completion.
# '''Human Error''' – Risks that are brought by the unavoidable mistakes made by humans involved in the project such as the project team, stakeholders, and personnel.

==13.3 Risk Management Approach==
Agile risk management values lean thinking and efficient communication. This means that for the SurveiRams risk management strategy, the focus will be data gathering and analysis before deciding on a course of action. Stakeholders, sponsors, and the project team must cooperate with each other for the risk management approach.

Specifically, these are the steps to be followed:   
* '''Risk Identification:''' Meetings will be held to discuss relevant risks encountered based from experience in other projects, and a Risk Register will be put together.
* '''Risk Assessment:''' A Risk Assessment Matrix will be constructed to rank the risks discussed based on the probability of its occurrence as well as the gravity of its impact on the project.
* '''Risk Mitigation:''' Mitigation plans will be made for the risks that have a high probability and extreme gravity, which include how to prevent them and minimize their impact. 
* '''Risk Monitoring:''' There might be unforeseen risks that could arise. To be ready to minimize or eliminate them, there will be a bi-monthly examination of the Risk Register, as well as another round of brainstorming for possible risks that haven’t been discussed. New risks discovered will be added to the Risk Register.
* '''Risk Communication:''' All stakeholders must regularly keep contact to be informed about the occurrences of risks and how they are handled. They must also be updated regarding changes in the risk management plan and process.

==13.4 Risk Identification==
After a thorough discussion with the project team, risks to SurveiRams were identified. The team organized these risks into the following categories:
* '''Technical:''' Risks related to technology 
* '''Cost:''' Risks related to the project budget
* '''Schedule:''' Risks related to the project timeline
* '''Communication:''' Risks related to communication among all stakeholders
* '''Skills Resource:''' Risks related to the project team’s skills and expertise
* '''Strategic:''' Risks related to the project team’s approach in accomplishing the project
* '''External Hazard:''' Risks related to nature, society, and the government

These are all the possible types of risks that could affect the project. Updates will be made in the event that another type is discovered. Specific risks under these categories will be discussed in the Risk Register below.

==13.5 Risk Qualification and Prioritization== 
A Risk Assessment Matrix based on probability and impact was created to aid in ranking the risks in the Risk Register.
<img src="https://github.com/apcjlquesada/APC_2022_2023_3rd_Term_PROJMAN/assets/97137055/7ee3c489-4c79-41f5-87e2-3884eb0ca07b" alt="Image description" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:30%;">
We have categorized the risks into four categories: Extreme, High, Medium, Low, and Negligible.   
   
The probability of risks happening and their impact on the project is described below:   
* Extreme: Risks with a very high probability of occurring and a severe impact on the project.
* High: Risks with a high probability of occurring and a significant impact on the project. These risks require immediate attention, and we need to develop mitigation strategies for them.  
* Medium: Risks with a medium probability of occurring and a moderate impact on the project. These risks should be closely monitored, and mitigation strategies should be developed in case they occur. 
* Low: Risks with a low probability of occurring and a minor impact on the project. These risks can be monitored periodically, and mitigation strategies can be developed in case they occur.
* Negligible: Risks with a very low probability of occurring and negligible impact on the project. These risks can be ignored.

The following are the identified risks and their prioritization based on probability and impact:   

'''Technical Risks:'''
* High probability and high impact   
* Lack of technical expertise to develop the system
* Failure of the new system to integrate with the current systems   
''' Resource Risks:'''   
* Medium probability and medium impact
* Inadequate resources for the project
'''Security Risks:'''
* Medium probability and medium impact 
* Unauthorized access to the system  

Based on the above prioritization, we will focus on developing mitigation strategies for the extreme and high priority risks first. We will continuously monitor the medium and low priority risks and develop mitigation strategies if required. The negligible priority risks will be ignored as they have a very low probability of occurring and have a negligible impact on the project.   
   
We will align this risk qualification and prioritization with the risk management plan of agile by regularly reviewing and updating the risk register throughout the project. We will also ensure that risks are included in sprint planning, so the team is aware of the risks and can plan accordingly. Additionally, we will encourage the team to identify and report any new risks they may come across during the project.   

==13.6 Risk Monitoring== 
The Agile Risk Management Plan of the Dispatch Directory System provides a framework for actively monitoring risks throughout the project. To achieve this, it is essential to continuously monitor risks during the project's entire life cycle and carefully document the process, including identifying conditions that may trigger risks.   
   
As part of the plan, the project manager will incorporate the high-scoring risks into the project schedule and assign a risk manager to oversee their monitoring. This will help the project manager determine when the risks require close attention and when the risk manager should report updates at the bi-weekly project team meetings. The risk manager will be responsible for keeping track of the risk trigger conditions.   
   
Furthermore, the project manager will make certain that the project team is aware of the identified risks and their potential impact on the project. The project team will be encouraged to notify the risk manager of any new risks or changes to existing risks, who will then assess and prioritize them accordingly.   
   
At bi-weekly team meetings, the risk manager will report on the status of identified risks, any new risks, and the effectiveness of mitigation plans. Any changes to the risk management plan that are required will be made in collaboration with the project team.   
   
In conclusion, the project team will implement the agile risk management methodology that emphasizes ongoing improvement and flexibility. The effectiveness of the risk management plan will be regularly assessed and adjusted as needed to ensure the project's objectives and quality standards will be an achievement.   

==13.7 Risk Mitigation and Avoidance== 
The risk management plan will be created by the project team based on the importance given to each risk. To prepare for probable delays, strategies could include creating backup plans, assigning more resources, or modifying project timetables. The project team will work with stakeholders to put mitigation techniques into place and continuously assess their efficacy.   
   
The first step in risk mitigation and avoidance is to identify and prioritize the potential risks. The project team should identify the risks with the highest probability and impact and develop strategies to mitigate or avoid them. The following are the key considerations and options available to the project manager:   
* '''Resource Allocation:''' It is crucial for the project to be successful and efficient that the project manager guarantees the team has the required resources, including proficiency, abilities, and knowledge, as well as access to tools and equipment. The project manager bears the responsibility of ensuring that these resources are available to the team to finish the project within the given budget and timeline.   
* '''Risk Assessment:''' The team should thoroughly analyze potential risks to effectively anticipate and address them. The project manager should complete the risk assessment early in the project and take prompt actions to identify and mitigate potential risks.   
* '''Contingency Planning:''' In order to be prepared for potential risks, the project team needs to come up with backup plans for contingencies. It's up to the project manager to supervise the development, testing, and confirmation of these plans for every potential risk.   
* '''Communication:''' To minimize risks and prevent misunderstandings, it's important for the project manager to promote clear and open communication between the project team, clients, and stakeholders.  
* '''Agile Approach:''' Using the Agile approach offers a flexible and responsive way to manage risks. The project manager needs to ensure that the team follows the Agile methodology, which enables ongoing risk management and the ability to adapt to changes.  
* '''Change Management:''' The Dispatch Directory System project should have a clear change management process in place to handle any unexpected changes. The project team must document, communicate, and obtain approval from relevant stakeholders for any changes. This will help the project manager to effectively manage and prevent potential risks, and successfully complete the project.

==13.8 Risk Register== 
From other part: The risk register is updated regularly to ensure that new risks are identified, and existing risks are managed effectively. The project team will continue to monitor and manage risks throughout the project lifecycle.   
   

The risk register, which will be kept up to date throughout the project, will include a thorough explanation of each risk, its likelihood, and potential effects, as well as any mitigation measures taken. To make sure the risk register appropriately reflects the project's current condition, it will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis. All stakeholders will have access to the risk registry, which will be kept in a central location.   
   
This risk management strategy, which emphasizes early and frequent risk identification, collaborative risk management, and ongoing risk monitoring, is generally in line with the Agile methodology. The Dispatch Directory System project team can lessen the effects of probable risks and raise the possibility that the project will succeed by anticipating and resolving them. Furthermore, the risk register for the Dispatch Directory System project will be kept in a shared document with the help of a cloud-based project management tool like Jira, Asana, or Trello. The project team will use this tool to track and prioritize risks, assign responsibilities, and track progress in risk mitigation.   
   
The following criteria will be used for the risk register:   
* Risk ID - each risk will be assigned a unique identifier.
* Risk Description - there will be a clear and concise description of the risk event. 
* Risk Category - will classify risks into technical, organizational, or legal categories.
* Risk Owner - will be responsible for monitoring and managing each risk.
* Probability - likelihood of a risk occurring is assessed using a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the lowest likelihood and 5 indicating the highest.
* Impact - the risk's potential impact on the project is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the least significant impact and 5 indicating the most significant impact. 
* Risk Score - the probability and impact scores are multiplied to determine the overall risk score. 
* Mitigation Strategy - outlines the specific measures to be taken to mitigate the risk. 
* Status - risk's current status, whether it is open, in progress, or closed, is also documented.   
* Target Resolution Date - anticipated date for risk resolution to be resolved.

=14. COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT PLAN=
==14.1 Introduction==
The Communications Management Plan is a critical component of the SurveiRams System project as it outlines the communication strategy and protocols for the project team and stakeholders. The plan defines the following:   
# The plan outlines the type of information that will be communicated, such as project updates, progress reports, risks, and issues. It also includes the level of detail and format of the information, such as whether it will be communicated verbally or in written form.  
# The plan outlines the methods of communication that will be used, such as meetings, email, telephone, web portal, etc. This ensures that all stakeholders are informed in a timely manner.   
# The plan outlines the frequency of project communications, both formal and informal, to ensure that stakeholders are kept informed on a regular basis.
# The plan defines the roles and responsibilities of team members and stakeholders in terms of communication, including who is responsible for disseminating project information. 
# The plan outlines the specific communication needs of all stakeholders and how they will be met, such as language requirements and accessibility.
# The plan outlines the resources allocated for communication, such as budget and personnel, to ensure that communication is effective and efficient.   
# The plan outlines the protocols for communicating sensitive or confidential information, including who must authorize the release of such information.   
# The plan defines a process for managing changes in communication or the communication process, including how changes are proposed, reviewed, and approved. This ensures that all stakeholders are aware of any changes and that the communication process remains consistent throughout the project.   
# The plan outlines the flow of communication within the project, including how information is shared between team members, stakeholders, and other project partners. This helps to ensure that all stakeholders are informed, and that information is shared in a timely manner.   
# The plan identifies any internal or external constraints that may affect project communications, such as legal or regulatory requirements, and outlines how these constraints will be addressed.   
# The plan outlines any standard templates, formats, or documents that must be used for communicating project information, such as progress reports or meeting minutes. This ensures that all stakeholders are provided with consistent and accurate information.   
# The plan includes an escalation process for resolving any communication-based conflicts or issues that may arise during the project. This helps to ensure that any communication-related issues are addressed and resolved in a timely manner.  

Overall, the Communications Management Plan is a key tool that helps to ensure that all stakeholders are informed, and that communication is effective and efficient throughout the SurveiRams System project.    
==14.2 Communications Management Approach==
The best communications management approach for the SurveiRams System project would be a combination of proactive and reactive strategies.   
   
Proactively, regular project status meetings will be held to ensure all stakeholders are informed and aware of the project’s progress. The project manager will hold regular meetings with the project team and communicate any updates, progress reports, risks, and issues. This will provide stakeholders with an overview of the project’s status and any potential roadblocks. Additionally, a Microsoft Teams team will be created to provide stakeholders with easy access to project information, such as meeting minutes, documents, and project status reports.   
   
Reactively, a clear and concise escalation process will be established to address any communication-based conflicts or issues that arise. The project manager will be readily available to stakeholders to answer any questions or concerns they may have and provide support and guidance when needed.   
   
In addition, a change control process will be implemented to manage any changes in communication or the communication process. This will ensure that any changes are approved by the Change Control Board and that stakeholders are informed of any changes in a timely manner.   
   
Overall, this approach ensures that the project team and stakeholders are kept informed and that any communication-based issues are handled in an efficient and effective manner.   

==14.3 Communications Management Constraints==
The Communications Management Constraints for the SurveiRams System project are a crucial aspect of the overall project management plan. These constraints help to define the limitations and boundaries that may impact the communication processes and strategies of the project. By identifying and addressing these constraints, the project team can proactively develop solutions to mitigate potential challenges and ensure the smooth flow of information throughout the project.    
   
This section of the Communications Management Plan will provide an overview of the key constraints that may impact the project's communication processes, including internal and external factors, technological limitations, and regulatory requirements.

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
==14.7 Communication Methods and Technologies==
To prevent misunderstandings, the team must maintain open communication with the stakeholders. To avoid this, the team must notify the stakeholders of the status of the project and what is happening with the system's development to keep them informed. Progress reports, problems, updates, and other pertinent information they need to be aware of all the source of updates. On the other hand, choosing the team's preferred method of communication requires careful consideration of both cost and security.
	
Factors to be considered in determining the best communication methods and technologies for the SurveiRams system:   
'''Stakeholder’s Preference'''
:: Stakeholders may prefer to meet online or face-to-face. It really depends on what mode of communication they want. Either way, if they want to meet online, the team may set a meeting through Microsoft Teams.
'''Type of Information'''
:: The team may just send an email with the links of their documents for the stakeholders to consult with that does not require a meeting. 
'''Budget and Resources Available'''
:: The chosen method of communication should be aligned with the budget. 
    
Therefore, the SurveiRams System suggests using a combination of project management software, email, and video conferencing apps like Microsoft Teams to keep the stakeholders updated and achieve the project's goals.

==14.10 Guidelines for Meetings==
Meeting guidelines are a set of principles and recommendations that help ensure effective and productive meetings. These guidelines serve as a framework for conducting meetings in a structured and efficient manner, promoting collaboration, engagement, and positive outcomes. The SurveiRams project is no exception. To ensure that meetings are productive, efficient, and effective, it is important to establish clear guidelines for meetings. These guidelines should include information on the purpose of meetings, the roles and responsibilities of attendees, and the procedures that will be followed during meetings.    

Having clearly outlined meeting guidelines enables project team members and stakeholders to come well-prepared and actively engage in discussions, enhancing their participation. Furthermore, it allows the project manager to maintain consistency and organization throughout meetings, preventing any potential confusion or misunderstandings.
   
The following guide is to help the project team to initiate a successful meeting:
* '''Define Clear Objectives:''' Start by clarifying the purpose and objectives of the meeting. Clearly communicate what you aim to accomplish. Ensure that all participants are aware of the desired outcomes.
* '''Prepare an Agenda:''' Create a well-structured agenda that outlines the topics to be discussed, the time allocated for each item and any necessary materials or preparations.
* '''Start and End on time:''' Punctuality is crucial for effective meetings. Begin the meeting promptly at the scheduled time, regardless of whether all participants are present. Respect everyone's time by ending the meeting on time.
* '''Encourage active participation:''' Create an environment that encourages people to participate and speak. Encourage diverse perspectives, ask open-ended questions, and provide opportunities for everyone to contribute.
* '''Allocate time effectively:''' Allocate sufficient time for each agenda item, considering its importance and complexity. Prioritize critical discussions and be mindful of time constraints. If needed, table less urgent topics for subsequent meetings.
* '''Document key points and action items:''' Assign someone to document the meeting minutes or key takeaways. Capture important decisions, action items, and responsibilities assigned to individuals. Share the minutes with participants after the meeting to ensure everyone is aligned.
* '''Follow up on action items:''' Monitor progress on action items and provide updates in subsequent meetings. Hold individuals accountable for their assigned tasks and track their completion. This ensures that the outcomes of the meeting are implemented effectively.

By adhering to these meeting guidelines, you can enhance the efficiency, collaboration, and overall effectiveness of your meetings, leading to better outcomes and stronger teamwork.

==14.11 Communication Standards==
The best communication standards for the SurveiRams project may include the following:  
* '''Regular Team Meetings:''' Schedule regular team meetings mostly once or twice a week to discuss project progress, address challenges, and ensure everyone is aligned. These meetings can be conducted in person or remotely, depending on the team's location. 
* '''Active listening:''' Engage in attentive listening, focusing on understanding others' perspectives and ideas. Avoid interrupting and demonstrate respect for the speaker by giving them your full attention.
* '''Clear and concise expression:''' Express your thoughts and ideas clearly, using simple and concise language. Avoid jargon or overly technical terms that may confuse others.
* '''Respectful dialogue:''' Foster a respectful and inclusive environment where all participants feel comfortable expressing their opinions. Treat others with courtesy and avoid engaging in personal attacks or disrespectful behavior.
* '''Constructive feedback:''' Provide feedback in a constructive and tactful manner, emphasizing specific points and suggestions for improvement. Avoid overly critical or negative language that may hinder collaboration.

* Access to online training materials and resources will be granted to APC management for further knowledge and skill development related to the system.
* APC management will be responsible for disseminating the information to BMO, ITRO, and security personnel, as formal classes may not be suitable given the fast-paced environment.

As part of the Knowledge Transfer Plan, regular check-ins and meetings will be scheduled between the project team, senior developer, and APC management to ensure successful knowledge transfer and prompt resolution of any questions or issues. Additionally, any system updates or changes will be documented and shared with APC management to ensure they are equipped with the latest information.

The initiation of the handover and acceptance process will commence upon the fulfillment of the implementation phase, encompassing all necessary documentation and deliverables. Subsequently, the project team will arrange a formal meeting with the project sponsor and other pertinent stakeholders to review the transition plan and verify the fulfillment of all requirements.

During the handover meeting, the project team will present the completed transition plan, along with all essential documentation and deliverables, to the project sponsor and relevant stakeholders. The presented materials will be thoroughly examined and discussed to address any remaining issues or concerns.

Once all matters are resolved, the project sponsor and stakeholders will endorse the formal acceptance document as proof of the successful completion of the handover. This acceptance document will encompass a checklist of all obligatory deliverables and documentation, featuring the signatures of the stakeholders who have reviewed and approved the materials.

Additionally, the handover and acceptance section will outline the procedure for resolving any lingering issues or concerns that may arise subsequent to the handover. This may involve following a formal dispute resolution process or implementing corrective measures to rectify identified deficiencies.

Overall, the handover and acceptance section within the contract transition out plan will offer a comprehensive and detailed roadmap for accomplishing the handover process, ensuring the satisfaction of all stakeholders with the outcomes.
