=13. RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN=
==13.1 Introduction==
SurveiRams is a mobile application designed to develop a centralized system for Asia Pacific College’s (APC) Information Technology Resources Office (ITRO), Management Office (BMO), and Security Office. The application will assist them in managing incident reports and logs as well as provide insights.

The Risk Management Plan is important for projects following the Agile Methodology to use as a guide on how to identify and respond to risks. The team must enumerate potential risks, plan for responses, and monitor and control said risks from the project’s start to finish. Upon completion, the plan will be used every day, and may be revised to fit the project’s needs better, thus ensuring that the objectives of the project are achieved on time within budget.

Contents of this document include a summary of the risk management process, describing the sequence of steps as well as who is assigned to do so. Next is a guide for what constitutes as a risk and their hierarchy. Followed by this is the monitoring and controlling process for the risks, and last is the risk register.
   
To further develop a risk management plan for the SurveiRams System, the following information should be considered:   
==13.2 Top Three Risks==
Every project has risks whether foreseen or not. However, in the situation of the SurveiRams project, the three biggest foreseen risks are the following:
# '''Technical Risks''' – Risks that are brought by evolving technology, such as failure from either or both software and hardware and cyberattacks resulting in data loss and/or security breaches.
# '''Insufficient Resources''' – Risks that are brought by the lack of project resources such as exceeding the project timeline or going over budget, which may delay the completion.
# '''Human Error''' – Risks that are brought by the unavoidable mistakes made by humans involved in the project such as the project team, stakeholders, and personnel.

==13.3 Risk Management Approach==
Agile risk management values lean thinking and efficient communication. This means that for the SurveiRams risk management strategy, the focus will be data gathering and analysis before deciding on a course of action. Stakeholders, sponsors, and the project team must cooperate with each other for the risk management approach.

Specifically, these are the steps to be followed:   
* '''Risk Identification:''' Meetings will be held to discuss relevant risks encountered based on experience from other projects, and a Risk Register will be put together.
* '''Risk Assessment:''' A Risk Assessment Matrix will be constructed to rank the risks discussed based on the probability of their occurrence as well as the gravity of its impact on the project.
* '''Risk Mitigation:''' Mitigation plans will be made for the risks that have a high probability and extreme gravity, which include how to prevent them and minimize their impact. 
* '''Risk Monitoring:''' There might be unforeseen risks that could arise. To be ready to minimize or eliminate them, there will be a bi-monthly examination of the Risk Register, as well as another round of brainstorming for possible risks that haven’t been discussed. New risks discovered will be added to the Risk Register.
* '''Risk Communication:''' All stakeholders must regularly keep contact to be informed about the occurrences of risks and how they are handled. They must also be updated regarding changes in the risk management plan and process.

==13.4 Risk Identification==
After a thorough discussion with the project team, risks to SurveiRams were identified. The team organized these risks into the following categories:
* '''Technical:''' Risks related to technology 
* '''Cost:''' Risks related to the project budget
* '''Schedule:''' Risks related to the project timeline
* '''Communication:''' Risks related to communication among all stakeholders
* '''Skills Resource:''' Risks related to the project team’s skills and expertise
* '''External Hazard:''' Risks related to nature, society, and the government

These are all the possible types of risks that could affect the project. Updates will be made in the event that another type is discovered. Specific risks under some of these categories will be discussed in the Risk Register below. 

==13.5 Risk Qualification and Prioritization== 
A Risk Assessment Matrix based on probability and impact was created to aid in ranking the risks in the Risk Register.
<img src="https://github.com/apcjlquesada/APC_2022_2023_3rd_Term_PROJMAN/assets/97137055/7ee3c489-4c79-41f5-87e2-3884eb0ca07b" alt="Image description" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:30%;">
As shown in Table 1, there are three levels each for the probability and impact of a risk. The lowest level is 1 and the highest is 3. The assessments are the following:
   
The probability of risks happening and their impact on the project is described below:   
* Low – These are risks with low impact and low probability. Risks assessed as low are negligible and are low priority. 
* Medium – These are risks with medium impact and probability. Risks assessed as medium must have mitigation plans at least drafted, and these are medium priority.
* High – These are risks with high impact and probability. Risks assessed as high must have finalized and strong mitigation plans ready and studied by the project team, as these are of high priority. 

==13.7 Risk Mitigation and Avoidance== 
A Risk Register was made for the project team to have a centralized guide to refer to upon encountering risks. This will be disseminated to all the stakeholders for easy access, so they can be prepared with their tasks and responsibilities when the time comes. Although there are numerous risks that could possibly happen, only the five most likely ones to occur for the SurveiRams project are listed below.

</table>  

Table 2, the Risk Register, shows the following information that are needed for managing the risks identified:  
# '''Risk ID -''' The unique identifier assigned to each risk. 
# '''Risk Category -''' Each risk is labelled based on the categories listed in Risk Identification it falls under.
# '''Risk Description -''' The explanation of what the risk is and its effects.
# '''Risk Assessment -''' The assessment of the risk based on the Risk Assessment Matrix.
# '''Owner -''' The person/s responsible for taking action for each risk.
# '''Mitigating/Avoiding Action -''' Indicates the steps needed to be done by the Owner to mitigate or avoid the risk. Risks assessed as low will have Avoiding Actions, while those assessed as high will have mitigating actions.

When a risk occurs, the Owner must inform all stakeholders between 24-48 hours depending on its impact. Next, they must send a Risk Mitigation Request Form (found in Appendix A) to the Project Sponsors containing the Risk ID, incident, cause, their plan to mitigate the risk, and request for the resources they need to do so. The Project Sponsors shall review the report and approve or provide the requested resources so that the Owner may proceed in mitigating the risk.

In case the system is down due to any risk except when there is no internet connection, the contingency plan is to use Microsoft Forms. The security guards may log their incident reports there instead of going back to manually writing in their log books. When the system is running again, the team can simply download the form’s responses and add it to the database. Another option is to input the details in the application.


==13.8 Risk Monitoring== 
Risk Management does not stop after mitigating the identified risks. They must be monitored continuously until the end of the project. After the risk’s Owner deals with the risk, they must inform all stakeholders of the risk’s status and submit a formal incident report to the Project Manager detailing the steps they took to solve the problems the risk caused. The Risk Incident Report format can be found in Appendix B.

Weekly meetings must be held by the project team to review the Risk Register, to ensure that the mitigating/avoiding actions are still effective. Stakeholders must be informed should an update be made for the Risk Register. These meetings must also include review of past risks that occurred to make sure the probability of their future occurrence is lower, identify what might cause this risk to repeat, and create a plan to avoid this.

To conclude, risks must be identified, assessed, mitigated or avoided, and monitored, with all of the stakeholders maintaining open communication. This is to ensure that the Risk Management Plan remains effective and up to date. Having this in this project will lead to an output that not only meets the objectives, but is of high quality.  


=14. COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT PLAN=
==14.1 Introduction==
The Communications Management Plan details the processes and strategies for communication that the project team and stakeholders of the SurveiRams project must follow. Planning this is important as communication between all stakeholders ensures good cooperation and a successful outcome that meets the project objectives.

The plan includes what approach the team is planning on using, as well as what might hinder effective communication among all stakeholders involved. The rest of the document discusses specific guidelines, agreements, and expectations on how communication will flow. The processes on how communication escalates within the hierarchy of all stakeholders depending on the need and reason are expounded on.
  
==14.2 Communications Management Approach==
The SurveiRams project will be taking the hybrid and two-way approach to manage communication between stakeholders. Each stakeholder has the option to choose whether communication with them will be online or in person, so as to accommodate their needs. This ensures that even distance will not hinder them to update each other with the project status, arising risks, and other matters related to the project. 

A team in Microsoft Teams will be created for a central communication zone. Documents such as management plans, meeting minutes, and status reports will be posted there for automatic cloud storage. 

The project team and stakeholders must have a two-way communication when needed. Feedback for one another or for every deliverable must be given to ensure stakeholder satisfaction as well as quality assurance.

==14.3 Communications Management Constraints==
There are some factors that could limit the communication processes among stakeholders in the project. Identifying these constraints will aid the project team in strategizing for mitigating and avoiding actions to ensure that the communication among them is efficient.
      
The following are the identified possible constraints:     
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Schedule of stakeholders</td>
      <td>The team members are students and most of the stakeholders are working full-time. Freeing time for meetings may be difficult.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Technical Issues</td>
      <td>Online meetings are part of the communication methods. Device condition, internet connection, and technology literacy may affect the communication process.</td>
    </tr>

==14.7 Communication Methods and Technologies==
To prevent misunderstandings, the team needs to be open with each other and the stakeholders. The team must inform the stakeholders of the project's status on a regular basis to avoid misunderstandings. The stakeholders will need information, including reports, issues, and updates for them to understand what is happening in the project.
	
Factors to be considered in determining the best communication methods and technologies for the SurveiRams system:   
  
'''Stakeholder’s Preference'''
:: Stakeholders may prefer to meet online or face-to-face. It really depends on what mode of communication they want. Either way, if they want to meet online, the team may set a meeting through Microsoft Teams.
'''Type of Information'''
:: The team may just send an email with the links of their documents for the stakeholders to consult with that does not require a meeting. This includes weekly updates, reports, and issues.
'''Budget and Resources Available'''
:: The chosen method of communication should be aligned with the budget. 
    
Therefore, the SurveiRams System suggests using a combination of project management software, email, and video conferencing apps like Microsoft Teams to keep the stakeholders updated and achieve the project's goals.

==14.10 Guidelines for Meetings==
The principles and recommendations in meeting guidelines serve to ensure successful meetings. These will serve as the project team's meeting protocol guidelines. encouraging interaction, participation, and successful outcomes. Project SurveiRams is not an exception, setting up clear meeting rules is crucial for ensuring that meetings are efficient, effective, and productive.   
 
Having clearly outlined meeting guidelines enables project team members and stakeholders to come well-prepared and actively engage in discussions, enhancing their participation. Furthermore, it allows the project manager to maintain consistency and organization throughout meetings, preventing any potential confusion or misunderstandings.
   
The following guide is to help the project team to initiate a successful meeting:

* '''Define Clear Objectives:''' Start by clarifying the purpose and objectives of the meeting. Clearly communicate what you aim to accomplish. Ensure that all participants are aware of the desired outcomes.
* '''Prepare an Agenda:''' Create a well-structured agenda that outlines the topics to be discussed, the time allocated for each item and any necessary materials or preparations.
* '''Start and End on time:''' Punctuality is crucial for effective meetings. Begin the meeting promptly at the scheduled time, regardless of whether all participants are present. Respect everyone's time by ending the meeting on time.
* '''Encourage active participation:''' Create an environment that encourages people to participate and speak. Encourage diverse perspectives, ask open-ended questions, and provide opportunities for everyone to contribute.
* '''Allocate time effectively:''' Allocate sufficient time for each agenda item, considering its importance and complexity. Prioritize critical discussions and be mindful of time constraints. If needed, table less urgent topics for subsequent meetings.
* '''Document key points and action items:''' Assign someone to document the meeting minutes or key takeaways. Capture important decisions, action items, and responsibilities assigned to individuals. Share the minutes with participants after the meeting to ensure everyone is aligned.
* '''Follow up on action items:''' Monitor progress on action items and provide updates in subsequent meetings. Hold individuals accountable for their assigned tasks and track their completion. This ensures that the outcomes of the meeting are implemented effectively.

By adhering to these meeting guidelines, the project team can enhance the efficiency, collaboration, and overall effectiveness of your meetings, leading to better outcomes and stronger teamwork.

==14.11 Communication Standards==
The best communication standards for the SurveiRams project may include the following:

=15. PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN=
==15.1 Introduction==
The project's success depends on the Procurement Management Plan. This plan outlines the project's procurement needs and describes how the process will be handled from the production of procurement papers to the signing of agreements. This plan aims to ensure that all necessary materials are purchased on schedule, within the allotted budget, and at the required quality level for the project. This plan outlines the kind of things that must be purchased, the justifications and deadlines to meet, the contract types to be employed, the risks associated with procurement management, and how these risks will be handled. Additionally, it explains how to calculate costs and assess vendors, including how to use templates and other common procurement methods.    
      
This plan also includes managing vendors, a vital element in the procurement process. In addition, it identifies any qualified sellers if necessary. The plan includes performance metrics for procurement operations in order to guarantee that the procurement procedure is monitored and controlled throughout the project's life cycle.   
   
To summarize, the Procurement Management Plan’s objective is to have an efficient and effective completion of the project’s procurement requirements while giving priority to the quality, cost, and schedule. This management provides a roadmap of the procurement process, for stakeholders to be aware and informed of what is happening in the development.

==15.2 Procurement Risks==
Procurement in every project is a vital component that should be taken with care because it involves budget in acquiring goods, services or work from external sources.  Having risks in the procurement may negatively impact the development. Therefore, it is an issue that should be addressed to minimize the impact on the project.
   
The SurveiRams System incorporates procurement processes that entail a number of hazards, including but not exclusive to the following:   
  
* Delivery of services or goods within the project timeline from vendor may result in increased costs.
* The absence of competition in the market may lead to higher prices or reduced quality of services.
* Commitments with the vendor and procurement activities may be compromised when there is a sudden change in the project scope, schedule or budget.
* Misunderstandings between the project team and the vendor may arise when there are no clear specifications, lack of documents and incorrect assumptions. 
* Poor communication with the vendor may lead to misunderstandings.
* Vendor does not comply with the regulatory requirements or legal issues, which may impact the project, team and stakeholder’s reputation.
* Inadequate vendor selection or evaluation may result into partnering with unreliable sources that has a low quality of goods or services.
* Contract management oversight may lead the vendor’s services or goods and the project team’s development to fail.

To mitigate these risks, the Procurement Management Plan includes detailed strategies for risk identification, assessment, and mitigation. The team will consistently monitor the plan throughout the project’s duration to specify and address the risks. Moreover, the team will impose accurate procurement processes to control the potential risks associated with procurement management.

==15.3 Procurement Risk Management==
1.  Identification of Procurement Risks  
The first step in managing procurement risks is to identify and assess them. For the SurveiRams System, potential procurement risks include:    
* Unexpected increase in the cost of goods or services   
* Delays in the delivery of goods or services
* Incomplete or substandard goods or services  
* Unclear or insufficient contract terms and conditions   
* Misalignment of the vendor’s goals with the project
* Inaccurate estimates of costs and timelines  
* Insufficient supplier qualifications
* Non-compliance service/goods with applicable laws or regulations
* Supply Chain disruptions
* Data breaches
* Contract Disputes/Payment Issues

2.  Risk Mitigation Strategies  
After identifying the potential procurement risks, it is ideal to plot a strategy to mitigate them. For the SurveiRams System, the following risk mitigation strategies will be put into action:
* Regularly monitoring and evaluating the vendor’s performance to ensure that they adhere to the project and the team’s standards and also to the laws and regulation standards.
* Implement an effective contract management practice to prevent vagueness and ensure clear information.
* Conducting research in the market to identify lists of reliable vendors with a good track record in delivering high-quality goods or services. 
* Establishing a clear delivery schedules, specifications and performance criteria for the procurement plan.
* Developing a comprehensive contract terms and conditions that protects the interests of the project and the team. 
* Having a contingency plan to address potential vendor bankruptcy.
* Conducting a regular risk assessment in the procurement process to identify and address emerging risks. 
* Conduct thorough market research and maintain up-to-date information on market trends and prices.
* Diversify the supply chain by having multiple suppliers to have an alternative if a supply chain disruption happens.
  
3.  Assignment of Responsibilities 
Every person in the team should be given a clear assignment of duties for controlling procurement risks. The procurement manager will be in charge of identifying and evaluating procurement risks for the SurveiRams System, creating risk mitigation plans, and keeping an eye on risk throughout the procurement process.    

Project manager and the team’ s input and feedback on procurement risk management strategies are also valuable and essential. 

4.  Communication and Reporting  
Communication and reporting in the process of procurement risk management is valuable. The regular updates on the procurement risks and risks mitigation activities will be provided to the team. Communication within the team may be held using online platforms if necessary.

Moreover, communication plan is developed for the stakeholders to keep informed in any changes or developments made in the procurement risk management.


5.  Continuous Improvement  
To improve future procurement planning and execution, lessons acquired from risk management and procurement operations will be recorded and communicated to the project team. It should be a constant practice to improve procurement risk management.
  
In order to identify areas for improvement, procurement risk management operations will also be regularly reviewed.      
 
==15.4 Cost Determination==
Determining costs is a key component of the SurveiRams System procurement process. The team will employ a thorough cost determination procedure to choose providers who are both competent and cost-efficient. As part of the cost estimation process, potential suppliers are asked to submit quotes, proposals, or bids in response to an RFP (Request for Proposal). The team must assess the costs related to the procurement process, such as acquisition, delivery, installation, and maintenance costs. The group will evaluate potential cost overruns as well as suggest measures to reduce them. To promote openness and equity in the selection process, the project team will make cost one of the primary deciding factors.    

The cost determination process will involve a number of stakeholders, such as procurement managers, project managers, financial analysts, project sponsor and team adviser. These parties will work together to make sure that the procurement budget is continuously tracked and that all expenditures are accurately estimated. The project team will use standardized procurement templates and papers to speed up the cost estimation procedure. This will make it easier to guarantee that all cost estimates are accurate and consistent across all procurement operations. The project team will also construct procurement performance measures to evaluate the efficiency of the cost estimation procedure.  
   
Overall, the procurement management plan's cost determination section will be extremely important in ensuring that the SurveiRams System is completed successfully and within the allotted budget. 

==15.5 Procurement Constraints==
The following constraints must be considered as part of the SurveiRams project’s procurement management process:      
# '''Budget Constraint:''' The project must be completed within a specific budgetary limit. This constraint restricts the team’s flexibility as the project must be aligned with the available financial resources.

==16.4 Workforce Transition==
The SurveiRams Ticketing System project's transition strategy places a lot of attention on the workforce transfer. A thorough workforce plan must be established and successfully communicated in order to guarantee a smooth and effective transition.

The Transition Project Manager will work closely with the customer, the existing and new contractors, as well as the transition team to decide on the best strategy for managing the workforce. This may include taking a variety of steps, including hiring new employees or transferring current employees to the new contractor.

In this process, timely and clear communication is essential because it's important to respectfully inform the workforce of any changes. The Transition Project Manager will make sure that all staff members are educated about their substitutes and receive the required support throughout the transition by collaborating closely with BMO, ITRO, and security management.

The employees will also receive all necessary training or retraining to ensure that they are fully prepared to provide great services both during and after the transition phase. With the ultimate objective of successfully completing the project within the allocated schedule and budget, the workforce transition plan will be subject to continuous assessment and adjustments as necessary.

==16.5 Workforce Execution During Transition==
During the transition period of the SurveiRams System project, several essential tasks will still need to be completed, which are as follows:

'''User Training:''' To inform users of the new system, training materials must be created and distributed. The training sessions would probably last two weeks and will combine classroom instruction with practical training.

'''System Testing:''' This signifies the official deployment of the new system. The team must make sure that every necessary component is in place and working properly before making it available to users. This will probably require performing final system tests and confirming the accuracy of the data migration.

'''Documentation of Lessons Learned:''' Documenting the project-related insights is part of this step. It comprises determining the team's strengths and weaknesses to make adjustments. The document will be a useful tool for next projects and encourage the use of best practices.

'''Finalize Project Deliverables:''' The group is in charge of updating relevant documents and records to reflect the project's completion. This can entail keeping copies of particular documents on hand or modifying contracts and agreements with new information.

'''Formal Acceptance:''' Getting the customer's formal approval during this phase signifies that the transfer was accomplished. The project team is responsible for making sure that all deliverables have been completed and that the customer is satisfied with the new system.

'''Archiving Files/Documents:''' All project-related files and papers will be archived during this time. Contracts, agreements, project plans, and other relevant documents may be included.

'''Project Closeout Meeting:''' A meeting with all stakeholders to close out the project is part of the transition's final phase. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the project as a whole, identify areas for success and improvement, and ensure that any unresolved concerns are addressed.  
 
==16.6 Subcontracts==
There is no requirement for any transition or transfer of contracts or related agreements because there are presently no contracts or subcontract agreements connected to this project.
==16.7 Property Transition==
===16.7.1 User Accounts and Passwords===
The transfer of user accounts and passwords must be covered in the project's transition strategy for the SurveiRams Ticketing System. The following lists the concerns and actions for this specific transitional phase:

'''User Account Inventory:'''
* To start with, a thorough inventory that details every user account and its corresponding privileges must be made. System administrators, BMO, ITRO, and end users (security employees) are a few examples of internal and external users that should be included in this inventory. It should also indicate which accounts are no longer active or required by the system.

'''Password Security:'''
* Security must be maintained as the top priority during the transition process, so all user passwords must be reset or disabled. This action protects the system and the data it contains against unwanted access. Users should be informed to change their passwords to a temporary one issued to them before the switch. The system owner should then insist that all users create new, secure passwords during the transfer.

'''User Database:'''
* The database for all user accounts to be moved or disabled should be part of the transition plan. This table has to have information like the login, linked email address, and relevant access rights. It should also specify any special instructions for the transition, whether the account will be moved or disabled.

In summary, the transition of user accounts and passwords is a critical aspect of the property transition plan for the SurveiRams Ticketing System project. By implementing a comprehensive account inventory, prioritizing password security, establishing clear procedures for account transition and disablement, and providing a user account table, a seamless and secure transition can be achieved.  

==16.8 Knowledge Transfer==
'''Documentation/Manuals:'''
* APC management, BMO, ITRO, and security staff will receive thorough documentation and manuals from the project team and senior developer.
* To improve APC management's knowledge of the system's operation, the documentation will include a project overview, system architecture, functional requirements, technical specifications, and other relevant documents.
* The guides will include thorough, step-by-step guidance on how to carry out particular system-related tasks.

'''Training:'''
* To achieve a complete understanding of the system and its operations, APC management will receive individualized training from the project team and senior developer.
* APC management will have access to online training materials and tools for the system's continued knowledge and skill growth.
* Formal classes might not be suitable given the busy setting; thus, APC management will be in charge of informing BMO, ITRO, and security people.

To guarantee successful knowledge transfer and quick resolution of any queries or difficulties, regular check-ins and meetings will be organized between the project team, senior developer, and APC management as part of the knowledge transfer plan. Any system updates or modifications will also be recorded and communicated to APC management so they have access to the most recent information.  
==16.9 Handover and Acceptance==
Upon completion of the implementation phase and the completion of all required documentation and deliverables, the handover and acceptance procedure will begin. The project team will then schedule an official meeting with the project sponsor and other important stakeholders to discuss the transition plan and confirm that all requirements have been met.

The project team will present the finalized transition plan, including all necessary paperwork and deliverables, to the project sponsor as well as relevant stakeholders during the handover meeting.  will carefully review the information provided and have a discussion to address any questions or concerns that may still be present.

The project sponsor and other interested parties will sign the formal acceptance document as evidence of the successful completion of the handover once all issues have been resolved. The stakeholders who have examined and accepted the contents will sign this acceptance form, which will include a checklist of all required deliverables and paperwork.

The handover and acceptance section will also describe how to address any unresolved problems or difficulties that may surface after the handover. This can entail adhering to a formal dispute resolution procedure or putting corrective measures in place to address found flaws.


Overall, the transition out plan's handover and acceptance section will provide a thorough and precise roadmap for carrying out the handover process, guaranteeing that all parties will be pleased with the results.
