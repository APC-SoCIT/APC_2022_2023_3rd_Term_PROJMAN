=13. RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN=
==13.1 Introduction==
SurveiRams is a mobile application designed to develop a centralized system for Asia Pacific College’s (APC) Information Technology Resources Office (ITRO), Management Office (BMO), and Security Office. The application will assist them in managing incident reports and logs as well as provide insights.

The Risk Management Plan is important for projects following the Agile Methodology to use as a guide on how to identify and respond to risks. The team must enumerate potential risks, plan for responses, and monitor and control said risks from the project’s start to finish. Upon completion, the plan will be used every day, and may be revised to fit the project’s needs better, thus ensuring that the objectives of the project are achieved on time within budget.

Contents of this document include a summary of the risk management process, describing the sequence of steps as well as who is assigned to do so. Next is a guide for what constitutes as a risk and their hierarchy. Followed by this is the monitoring and controlling process for the risks, and last is the risk register.
   
To further develop a risk management plan for the SurveiRams System, the following information should be considered:   
==13.2 Top Three Risks==
Every project has risks whether foreseen or not. However, in the situation of the SurveiRams project, the three biggest foreseen risks are the following:
# '''Technical Risks''' – Risks that are brought by evolving technology, such as failure from either or both software and hardware and cyberattacks resulting in data loss and/or security breaches.
# '''Insufficient Resources''' – Risks that are brought by the lack of project resources such as exceeding the project timeline or going over budget, which may delay the completion.
# '''Human Error''' – Risks that are brought by the unavoidable mistakes made by humans involved in the project such as the project team, stakeholders, and personnel.

==13.3 Risk Management Approach==
Agile risk management values lean thinking and efficient communication. This means that for the SurveiRams risk management strategy, the focus will be data gathering and analysis before deciding on a course of action. Stakeholders, sponsors, and the project team must cooperate with each other for the risk management approach.

Specifically, these are the steps to be followed:   
* '''Risk Identification:''' Meetings will be held to discuss relevant risks encountered based on experience from other projects, and a Risk Register will be put together.
* '''Risk Assessment:''' A Risk Assessment Matrix will be constructed to rank the risks discussed based on the probability of their occurrence as well as the gravity of its impact on the project.
* '''Risk Mitigation:''' Mitigation plans will be made for the risks that have a high probability and extreme gravity, which include how to prevent them and minimize their impact. 
* '''Risk Monitoring:''' There might be unforeseen risks that could arise. To be ready to minimize or eliminate them, there will be a bi-monthly examination of the Risk Register, as well as another round of brainstorming for possible risks that haven’t been discussed. New risks discovered will be added to the Risk Register.
* '''Risk Communication:''' All stakeholders must regularly keep contact to be informed about the occurrences of risks and how they are handled. They must also be updated regarding changes in the risk management plan and process.

==13.4 Risk Identification==
After a thorough discussion with the project team, risks to SurveiRams were identified. The team organized these risks into the following categories:
* '''Technical:''' Risks related to technology 
* '''Cost:''' Risks related to the project budget
* '''Schedule:''' Risks related to the project timeline
* '''Communication:''' Risks related to communication among all stakeholders
* '''Skills Resource:''' Risks related to the project team’s skills and expertise
* '''External Hazard:''' Risks related to nature, society, and the government

These are all the possible types of risks that could affect the project. Updates will be made in the event that another type is discovered. Specific risks under some of these categories will be discussed in the Risk Register below. 

==13.5 Risk Qualification and Prioritization== 
A Risk Assessment Matrix based on probability and impact was created to aid in ranking the risks in the Risk Register.
<img src="https://github.com/apcjlquesada/APC_2022_2023_3rd_Term_PROJMAN/assets/97137055/7ee3c489-4c79-41f5-87e2-3884eb0ca07b" alt="Image description" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:30%;">
As shown in Table 1, there are three levels each for the probability and impact of a risk. The lowest level is 1 and the highest is 3. The assessments are the following:
   
The probability of risks happening and their impact on the project is described below:   
* Low – These are risks with low impact and low probability. Risks assessed as low are negligible and are low priority. 
* Medium – These are risks with medium impact and probability. Risks assessed as medium must have mitigation plans at least drafted, and these are medium priority.
* High – These are risks with high impact and probability. Risks assessed as high must have finalized and strong mitigation plans ready and studied by the project team, as these are of high priority. 

==13.7 Risk Mitigation and Avoidance== 
A Risk Register was made for the project team to have a centralized guide to refer to upon encountering risks. This will be disseminated to all the stakeholders for easy access, so they can be prepared with their tasks and responsibilities when the time comes. Although there are numerous risks that could possibly happen, only the five most likely ones to occur for the SurveiRams project are listed below.

</table>  

Table 2, the Risk Register, shows the following information that are needed for managing the risks identified:  
# '''Risk ID -''' The unique identifier assigned to each risk. 
# '''Risk Category -''' Each risk is labelled based on the categories listed in Risk Identification it falls under.
# '''Risk Description -''' The explanation of what the risk is and its effects.
# '''Risk Assessment -''' The assessment of the risk based on the Risk Assessment Matrix.
# '''Owner -''' The person/s responsible for taking action for each risk.
# '''Mitigating/Avoiding Action -''' Indicates the steps needed to be done by the Owner to mitigate or avoid the risk. Risks assessed as low will have Avoiding Actions, while those assessed as high will have mitigating actions.

When a risk occurs, the Owner must inform all stakeholders between 24-48 hours depending on its impact. Next, they must send a Risk Mitigation Request Form (found in Appendix A) to the Project Sponsors containing the Risk ID, incident, cause, their plan to mitigate the risk, and request for the resources they need to do so. The Project Sponsors shall review the report and approve or provide the requested resources so that the Owner may proceed in mitigating the risk.

In case the system is down due to any risk except when there is no internet connection, the contingency plan is to use Microsoft Forms. The security guards may log their incident reports there instead of going back to manually writing in their log books. When the system is running again, the team can simply download the form’s responses and add it to the database. Another option is to input the details in the application.


==13.8 Risk Monitoring== 
Risk Management does not stop after mitigating the identified risks. They must be monitored continuously until the end of the project. After the risk’s Owner deals with the risk, they must inform all stakeholders of the risk’s status and submit a formal incident report to the Project Manager detailing the steps they took to solve the problems the risk caused. The Risk Incident Report format can be found in Appendix B.

Weekly meetings must be held by the project team to review the Risk Register, to ensure that the mitigating/avoiding actions are still effective. Stakeholders must be informed should an update be made for the Risk Register. These meetings must also include review of past risks that occurred to make sure the probability of their future occurrence is lower, identify what might cause this risk to repeat, and create a plan to avoid this.

To conclude, risks must be identified, assessed, mitigated or avoided, and monitored, with all of the stakeholders maintaining open communication. This is to ensure that the Risk Management Plan remains effective and up to date. Having this in this project will lead to an output that not only meets the objectives, but is of high quality.  


=14. COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT PLAN=
==14.1 Introduction==
The Communications Management Plan details the processes and strategies for communication that the project team and stakeholders of the SurveiRams project must follow. Planning this is important as communication between all stakeholders ensures good cooperation and a successful outcome that meets the project objectives.

The plan includes what approach the team is planning on using, as well as what might hinder effective communication among all stakeholders involved. The rest of the document discusses specific guidelines, agreements, and expectations on how communication will flow. The processes on how communication escalates within the hierarchy of all stakeholders depending on the need and reason are expounded on.
  
==14.2 Communications Management Approach==
The SurveiRams project will be taking the hybrid and two-way approach to manage communication between stakeholders. Each stakeholder has the option to choose whether communication with them will be online or in person, so as to accommodate their needs. This ensures that even distance will not hinder them to update each other with the project status, arising risks, and other matters related to the project. 

A team in Microsoft Teams will be created for a central communication zone. Documents such as management plans, meeting minutes, and status reports will be posted there for automatic cloud storage. 

The project team and stakeholders must have a two-way communication when needed. Feedback for one another or for every deliverable must be given to ensure stakeholder satisfaction as well as quality assurance.

==14.3 Communications Management Constraints==
There are some factors that could limit the communication processes among stakeholders in the project. Identifying these constraints will aid the project team in strategizing for mitigating and avoiding actions to ensure that the communication among them is efficient.
      
The following are the identified possible constraints:     
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Schedule of stakeholders</td>
      <td>The team members are students and most of the stakeholders are working full-time. Freeing time for meetings may be difficult.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Technical Issues</td>
      <td>Online meetings are part of the communication methods. Device condition, internet connection, and technology literacy may affect the communication process.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Time constraints</td>
      <td>The amount of communication between stakeholders might be low due to limited time to do so.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

==14.4 Stakeholder Communication Requirements==
The Stakeholder Communication Requirements are a vital component of the SurveiRams System project as they outline the specific communication needs of all stakeholders involved in the project. Effective communication is essential for ensuring that the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders. By identifying and addressing the communication requirements of stakeholders, the project team can proactively manage expectations, build trust, and foster collaboration.    
  
This section of the Communications Management Plan outlines the specific communication needs of stakeholders and how they will be met throughout the project's lifecycle.   
   
The stakeholder communication requirements for the Dispatch Directory System project would likely include:

==14.7 Communication Methods and Technologies==
To prevent misunderstandings, the team must maintain open communication with the stakeholders. To avoid this, the team must notify the stakeholders of the status of the project and what is happening with the system's development to keep them informed. Progress reports, problems, updates, and other pertinent information they need to be aware of all the source of updates. On the other hand, choosing the team's preferred method of communication requires careful consideration of both cost and security.
	
Factors to be considered in determining the best communication methods and technologies for the SurveiRams system:   
'''Stakeholder’s Preference'''
:: Stakeholders may prefer to meet online or face-to-face. It really depends on what mode of communication they want. Either way, if they want to meet online, the team may set a meeting through Microsoft Teams.
'''Type of Information'''
:: The team may just send an email with the links of their documents for the stakeholders to consult with that does not require a meeting. 
'''Budget and Resources Available'''
:: The chosen method of communication should be aligned with the budget. 
    
Therefore, the SurveiRams System suggests using a combination of project management software, email, and video conferencing apps like Microsoft Teams to keep the stakeholders updated and achieve the project's goals.

==14.10 Guidelines for Meetings==
Meeting guidelines are a set of principles and recommendations that help ensure effective and productive meetings. These guidelines serve as a framework for conducting meetings in a structured and efficient manner, promoting collaboration, engagement, and positive outcomes. The SurveiRams project is no exception. To ensure that meetings are productive, efficient, and effective, it is important to establish clear guidelines for meetings. These guidelines should include information on the purpose of meetings, the roles and responsibilities of attendees, and the procedures that will be followed during meetings.    

Having clearly outlined meeting guidelines enables project team members and stakeholders to come well-prepared and actively engage in discussions, enhancing their participation. Furthermore, it allows the project manager to maintain consistency and organization throughout meetings, preventing any potential confusion or misunderstandings.
   
The following guide is to help the project team to initiate a successful meeting:
* '''Define Clear Objectives:''' Start by clarifying the purpose and objectives of the meeting. Clearly communicate what you aim to accomplish. Ensure that all participants are aware of the desired outcomes.
* '''Prepare an Agenda:''' Create a well-structured agenda that outlines the topics to be discussed, the time allocated for each item and any necessary materials or preparations.
* '''Start and End on time:''' Punctuality is crucial for effective meetings. Begin the meeting promptly at the scheduled time, regardless of whether all participants are present. Respect everyone's time by ending the meeting on time.
* '''Encourage active participation:''' Create an environment that encourages people to participate and speak. Encourage diverse perspectives, ask open-ended questions, and provide opportunities for everyone to contribute.
* '''Allocate time effectively:''' Allocate sufficient time for each agenda item, considering its importance and complexity. Prioritize critical discussions and be mindful of time constraints. If needed, table less urgent topics for subsequent meetings.
* '''Document key points and action items:''' Assign someone to document the meeting minutes or key takeaways. Capture important decisions, action items, and responsibilities assigned to individuals. Share the minutes with participants after the meeting to ensure everyone is aligned.
* '''Follow up on action items:''' Monitor progress on action items and provide updates in subsequent meetings. Hold individuals accountable for their assigned tasks and track their completion. This ensures that the outcomes of the meeting are implemented effectively.

By adhering to these meeting guidelines, you can enhance the efficiency, collaboration, and overall effectiveness of your meetings, leading to better outcomes and stronger teamwork.

==14.11 Communication Standards==
The best communication standards for the SurveiRams project may include the following:  
* '''Regular Team Meetings:''' Schedule regular team meetings mostly once or twice a week to discuss project progress, address challenges, and ensure everyone is aligned. These meetings can be conducted in person or remotely, depending on the team's location. 
* '''Active listening:''' Engage in attentive listening, focusing on understanding others' perspectives and ideas. Avoid interrupting and demonstrate respect for the speaker by giving them your full attention.
* '''Clear and concise expression:''' Express your thoughts and ideas clearly, using simple and concise language. Avoid jargon or overly technical terms that may confuse others.
* '''Respectful dialogue:''' Foster a respectful and inclusive environment where all participants feel comfortable expressing their opinions. Treat others with courtesy and avoid engaging in personal attacks or disrespectful behavior.
* '''Constructive feedback:''' Provide feedback in a constructive and tactful manner, emphasizing specific points and suggestions for improvement. Avoid overly critical or negative language that may hinder collaboration.
* '''Clarity in questioning:''' Ask clear and relevant questions to seek clarification, gather information, or prompt deeper discussion. Avoid vague or ambiguous questions that may lead to confusion.
* '''Summarize and recap:''' Periodically summarize key points and takeaways from the discussion to ensure everyone is on the same page. This helps consolidate information and maintain focus throughout the meeting.
* '''Follow up:''' After the meeting, ensure that any action items or decisions are documented and communicated to relevant parties. Take responsibility for assigned tasks and provide updates as necessary.
* '''Communication Channels:''' Establish clear channels of communication for the project team, such as email, instant messaging platforms, project management tools, or collaboration software. Ensure that everyone knows which channels to use for different types of communication.
* '''Documentation:''' Emphasize the importance of documenting project-related information. This includes maintaining a project repository for code and design assets, documenting requirements, technical specifications, meeting minutes, and any decisions made during the project.
* '''Status Updates:''' Regularly provide status updates on project milestones, progress, and any blockers or challenges. This can be done through project management tools, email, or shared documents. Transparent and timely communication helps the team stay informed and take necessary actions.

==14.12 Communication Escalation Process==
The ideal and best communication escalation process for the SurveiRams project would involve the following steps:  
# '''Direct Communication:''' Encourage team members to communicate directly with each other for routine project-related matters. This includes discussions about tasks, progress updates, and minor issues. Team members should be able to resolve these matters through open and direct communication.
# '''Team Lead/Manager Involvement:''' If a communication issue persists or if team members are unable to resolve it directly, the next step is to involve the respective team lead or manager. The team lead or manager can mediate the discussion, clarify misunderstandings, and help find a resolution.
# '''Project Manager/Project Sponsor Involvement:''' If the issue remains unresolved or requires higher-level intervention, it should be escalated to the project manager or project sponsor. The project manager or sponsor will assess the situation, provide guidance, and take necessary actions to address the issue.
# '''Project Stakeholder Involvement:''' In cases where the issue involves project stakeholders, such as clients or end-users, and it cannot be resolved at the team level, escalate the matter to the project stakeholder(s). This may include scheduling a meeting or providing a detailed written report outlining the issue and the attempts made to resolve it.
# '''Post-Incident Review:''' After a communication issue has been resolved, conduct a post-incident review to analyze the root cause, identify areas for improvement, and implement any necessary corrective or preventive actions. This review helps prevent similar communication issues in the future.

It's important to note that the escalation process should be flexible and adaptable to the specific needs of the project. The project team should review the escalation process regularly to ensure that it remains effective and efficient in addressing communication related issues.

=15. PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN=
==15.1 Introduction==
The project's success depends on the Procurement Management Plan. The procurement requirements for the project are outlined in this plan, with how the procurement process will be managed from the creation of procurement paperwork to the conclusion of contracts. This strategy attempts to assure that all necessary materials are acquired within the budget, on schedule and in accordance with the level of quality needed for the project. The kinds of items that need to be acquired, the justifications and timetables to accomplish, the contract types to be used, the risks connected to procurement management, and how these risks will be addressed are all specified in this strategy. It also describes how to determine costs and evaluate vendors, including how to use templates and other forms of standard procurement.   

Management of vendors, a crucial step in the procurement process, is also included in this strategy. In addition, it identifies any qualified sellers if necessary. The plan includes performance metrics for procurement operations in order to guarantee that the procurement procedure is monitored and controlled throughout the project's life cycle.   
   
To summarize, Procurement Management Plan’s objective is to have an efficient and effective completion on the project’s procurement requirements while giving a priority on the quality, cost, and schedule. This management provides a roadmap of the procurement process, for stakeholders to be aware and informed of what is happening in the development.

==15.2 Procurement Risks==
Procurement in every project is a vital component that should be taken with care because it involves budget in acquiring goods, services or work from external sources.  Having risks in the procurement may negatively impact the development. Therefore, it is an issue that should be addressed to minimize the impact on the project.
   
The SurveiRams System incorporates procurement processes that entail a number of hazards, including but not exclusive to the following:   
* Delivery of services or goods within the project timeline from vendor may result in increased costs.
* The absence of competition in the market may lead to higher prices or reduced quality of goods and services.
* Commitments with the vendor and procurement activities may be compromised when there will be a sudden change in the project scope, schedule or budget.
* Misunderstandings between the project team and the vendor may arise when there are no clear specifications, lack of documents and incorrect assumptions.
* Poor communication with the vendor may lead to misunderstandings.
* Vendor does not comply with the regulatory requirements or legal issues, which may impact the project, team and stakeholder’s reputation.
* Inadequate vendor selection or evaluation may result into partnering with unreliable sources that has a low quality of goods or services.
* Contract management oversight may lead the vendor’s services or goods and the project team’s development to fail.

To mitigate these risks, the Procurement Management Plan includes detailed strategies for risk identification, assessment, and mitigation. The team will consistently monitor the plan throughout the project’s duration to specify and address the risks. Moreover, the team will impose accurate procurement processes to control the potential risks associated with procurement management.

==15.3 Procurement Risk Management==
1.  Identification of Procurement Risks  
The first step in managing procurement risks is to identify and assess them. For the SurveiRams System, potential procurement risks include: 
* Unexpected increase in the cost of goods or services
* Delays in the delivery of goods or services
* Vendor bankruptcy 
* Incomplete or substandard goods or services  
* Unclear or insufficient contract terms and conditions 
* Misalignment of the vendor’s goals with the project
* Inaccurate estimates of costs and timelines  
* Insufficient supplier qualifications

2.  Risk Mitigation Strategies  
After identifying the potential procurement risks, it is ideal to plot a strategy to mitigate them. For the SurveiRams System, the following risk mitigation strategies will be put into action:
* Regularly monitoring and evaluating the vendor’s performance to ensure that they adhere the project and the team’s standards.
* Implement an effective contract management practice to prevent vagueness and ensure clear information.
* Conducting research in the market to identify lists of reliable vendors with a good track record in delivering high-quality goods or services.
* Establishing a clear delivery schedules, specifications and performance criteria for the procurement plan.
* Developing a comprehensive contract terms and conditions that protects the interests of the project and the team.
* Having a contingency plan to address potential vendor bankruptcy.
* Conducting a regular risk assessment in the procurement process to identify and address emerging risks.  
3.  Assignment of Responsibilities 
Every person in the team should be given a clear assignment of duties for controlling procurement risks. The procurement manager will be in charge of identifying and evaluating procurement risks for the SurveiRams System, creating risk mitigation plans, and keeping an eye on risk throughout the procurement process. Project manager and the team’s input and feedback on procurement risk management strategies are also valuable and essential.
 
4.  Communication and Reporting  
Communication and reporting in the process of procurement risk management is valuable. The regular updates on the procurement risks and risks mitigation activities will be provided to the team. Moreover, communication plan is developed for the stakeholders to keep informed in any changes or developments made in the procurement risk management.

5.  Continuous Improvement
