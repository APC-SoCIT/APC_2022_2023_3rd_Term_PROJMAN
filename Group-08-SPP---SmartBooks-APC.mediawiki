To make sure that the timeline is reasonable, attainable, and in line with stakeholders' expectations, regular contact and coordination will be maintained. </p>

<p> Roles and responsibilities for schedule development will be clearly defined. The project manager will oversee the overall schedule development process, including task assignment, sequencing, and duration estimation. Project team members will be responsible for providing accurate and timely updates on task progress, dependencies, and any potential schedule impacts. The project manager will also collaborate with stakeholders to validate and finalize the schedule, ensuring that it reflects their requirements and constraints. </p>

== Schedule Control == 

<p> The SmartBooks project's schedule will be thoroughly watched and managed the entire time to guarantee that all activities and milestones are finished on time. The following procedures and methods will be used to effectively control the schedule: </p>

<ul> 
<li> <b> Schedule Updates and Reviews: </b>  The project schedule will be regularly updated to reflect actual progress and any changes or adjustments to the project plan. Updates will be performed on a weekly basis to capture the latest status of tasks, milestones, and dependencies. Additionally, comprehensive schedule reviews will be conducted at key project milestones to assess the overall progress and identify any potential deviations from the planned schedule. </li>
<li> <b> Communication and Reporting: </b> Clear and concise communication channels will be established to share schedule updates, progress reports, and any schedule-related information with relevant stakeholders. The project manager will be responsible for providing regular updates to the project team, key stakeholders, and management. Progress reports will include information on completed tasks, upcoming milestones, critical path analysis, and any schedule variances or risks. </li>
<li> <b> Roles and Responsibilities: </b> The project manager will have overall responsibility for schedule control, including monitoring and tracking project progress against the schedule. The project team members will be responsible for providing accurate and timely updates on task completion and any potential delays or issues that may impact the schedule. Key stakeholders will be actively engaged in reviewing and approving schedule changes, as well as providing input on any necessary adjustments to maintain project timelines. </li>
<li> <b> Schedule Change Control: </b> Any changes to the project schedule will follow the established change control process. This process will involve evaluating the impact of proposed changes on the schedule, including resource availability, dependencies, and overall project objectives. Changes will be assessed for their feasibility, and appropriate approval and documentation will be obtained before implementing any modifications to the schedule. </li>
</ul>

== Schedule Changes and Thresholds == 

<p> To maintain control over the project schedule and ensure alignment with the project objectives, the SmartBooks project establishes schedule changes and thresholds. The following guidelines and thresholds will be implemented: </p>

<ul> 
<li> <b> Boundary Conditions: </b> The project sponsor, in collaboration with the project manager, will define the initial schedule parameters and boundary conditions. These boundary conditions serve as the baseline for the project's schedule and represent the expected timeline for project completion. Any changes to the schedule that exceed these boundary conditions must go through a formal change control process. </li>
<li> <b> Change Threshold: </b> The project has established a change threshold of 10% for schedule changes. This means that any proposed schedule change that exceeds a 10% deviation from the baseline schedule will require a schedule change request to be submitted. The project sponsor will review and approve schedule change requests based on their impact, feasibility, and alignment with project objectives. </li>
<li> <b> Schedule Change Request: </b> When a schedule change is anticipated or required, the project team member responsible for the task or activity must submit a schedule change request. This request should include details such as the reason for the change, the proposed adjustments to the schedule, the potential impact on other tasks or milestones, and any necessary supporting documentation. </li>
<li> <b> Schedule Change Approval: </b> The project sponsor will evaluate each schedule change request based on its merits and alignment with the project objectives. The approval decision will consider factors such as the overall impact on project timelines, resource availability, budget implications, and potential risks. Only approved schedule changes will be implemented. </li>
</ul>

<p> Please note that the specific threshold and change management process can be tailored according to the project's requirements and in consultation with relevant stakeholders and project sponsors. </p>

== Scope Change ==

<p> The project timetable may be affected by approved modifications to the project's scope and may need to be adjusted. Modifications to the project's scope may result in the addition of deliverables, specifications, or other elements that were not initially planned for in the baseline timeline. The project manager and team must carefully assess the impact of such changes on the schedule and its resources as the project moves forward. </p> 

<ul> 
<li> <b> Evaluation of Scope Change: </b> When a scope change is proposed or approved, the project manager will assess its potential impact on the project schedule. This evaluation will consider factors such as the added work effort, resources required, dependencies with existing tasks, and overall schedule feasibility. </li>

<li> <b> Schedule Impact Analysis: </b> The project team, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, will conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine how the scope change will affect the project schedule. This analysis will include assessing the duration, sequencing, and resource allocation for the impacted tasks or deliverables. </li>

<li> <b> Re-baselining Schedule: </b> If the approved scope change significantly impacts the project schedule, it may be necessary to re-baseline the schedule. Re-baselining involves updating the project's baseline schedule to reflect the revised scope and associated timeline. This ensures that the project remains aligned with the updated objectives and requirements. </li>

<li> <b> Communication and Stakeholder Engagement: </b> Throughout the scope change process, effective communication with stakeholders is crucial. The project manager will keep stakeholders informed about the proposed scope changes, their impact on the schedule, and any adjustments made to the baseline schedule. Stakeholder engagement will help manage expectations and ensure alignment with the project's objectives. </li>
</ul>

<p> Please note that the scope change process and its integration with the project schedule may vary based on the specific requirements and dynamics of the SmartBooks project. </p>
