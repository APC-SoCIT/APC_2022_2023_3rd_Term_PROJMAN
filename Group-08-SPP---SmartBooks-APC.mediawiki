# Stakeholder Management Strategy Plan

## Introduction

Stakeholder management must be done effectively for any project to succeed. Among them is the program SmartBooks, whose objective is to increase the library's acquisition and utilization of printed books and eBooks. To ensure that the project is completed on schedule, within budget, and to everyone's satisfaction, a comprehensive stakeholder management strategy must be developed. The strategy's primary goals are to identify all stakeholders, analyze their interests, and decide how much communication and engagement is necessary to keep them informed and involved throughout the project's lifespan. With the aid of this strategy, we seek to lessen stakeholder opposition, disagreement, and conflict resulting from competing agendas and instead foster a supportive environment that will aid in the successful deployment of SmartBooks.

## Identify Stakeholders 

To effectively manage stakeholders for the SmartBooks project, the project team will use a systematic approach to identify all relevant stakeholders and their specific roles in the project. 
The team will use a combination of techniques to identify additional stakeholders, including reviewing project documentation, conducting interviews with key personnel, and analyzing organizational charts. It is important to note that stakeholders are not limited to those directly involved in the project but may also include those indirectly impacted by the project, such as customers or suppliers.
The team will classify each stakeholder when they have been identified based on their level of impact, interest, and influence on the project. The team will be able to prioritize their interactions with stakeholders thanks to this classification and modify their communication and engagement plans in accordance with their unique requirements and preferences. The project team can guarantee that the project is finished on schedule, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders by properly identifying and managing stakeholders.

## Key Stakeholders

The key stakeholders for the SmartBooks project have been identified as Mr. Jojo Castillo, the sponsor, and the Asia Pacific College Library. Mr. Castillo is a key stakeholder due to his role as the project sponsor and his authority to provide necessary resources and support for the project. The Asia Pacific College Library is a key stakeholder due to their direct involvement in the project and their potential to be most affected by the project's outcomes. As the primary beneficiary of the project, it is important to ensure that their needs and requirements are met throughout the project's lifecycle. Additionally, their feedback and involvement will be crucial to the success of the project. Effective communication and management with these key stakeholders will be necessary to ensure their support and buy-in for the project.

## Stakeholder Analysis

The stakeholder analysis of SmartBooks involves categorizing and grouping the identified stakeholders based on their level of power, influence, and involvement in the project. Key stakeholders have been identified as Mr. Jojo Castillo, the Asia Pacific College Library, and other stakeholders such as faculty members, students, and staff. The project team will use tools and techniques such as stakeholder mapping and prioritization to analyze and quantify the stakeholders. The analysis will help the team identify potential issues and opportunities, anticipate resistance or competing objectives, and determine the appropriate level of communication and engagement with each stakeholder.

= Scope Management Plan Template = 

<h2> Introduction </h2> 

<p> Project management's key component of scope management is ensuring that the project stays on track and achieves its goals. The project team's duties and responsibilities are outlined in the scope management plan, along with the procedures that will be used to define, develop, and validate the project's scope. Because it offers a clear road map for managing and controlling the project's scope throughout its lifecycle, this plan is essential to the project's success. To manage the project scope efficiently, we will use a five-step procedure in this plan: gather requirements, define scope, create WBS, verify scope, and control scope. By taking these actions, we can make sure that SmartBooks incorporates all the work required to accomplish its objectives while removing extraneous effort. </p> 

<h2> Scope Managemeng Approach </h2>

<p> The scope management approach for SmartBooks involves a clear delineation of authority and responsibility for scope management. The project manager is ultimately responsible for scope management, while the project sponsor has the authority to approve changes to the scope. The scope will be defined through a combination of the Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, and Statement of Work. </p> 

<p> Through various quality checklists, the scope baseline, and work performance measurements, the scope will be assessed and verified. Changes will be initiated by the project team, reviewed by the project sponsor, and approved by the change control board. The scope change process will be carefully monitored in this way. </p> 

<p> The project team will guarantee that the final deliverable is produced in accordance with the project scope that has been accepted and that the project sponsor has given their approval. This strategy will enable SmartBooks to efficiently manage the project scope and guarantee that it is delivered on schedule, under budget, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders. </p>
