<ul>
	<li>Schedule Variance (SV)</li>
	<li>Cost Variance (CV)</li>
	<li>Schedule Performance Index (SPI)</li>
	<li>Cost Performance Index (CPI)</li>

=Schedule Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            The Schedule Management Plan is the process of structuring the strategies, systems, and documentation for planning, developing, overseeing, executing, and controlling the project’s schedule. The importance of this process that it provides instruction and knowledge on how the project’s schedule will be controlled throughout the whole project. The schedule management plan includes identifying methodologies and techniques, analyzing, controlling, limitations, prioritizing and distributing all time related changes in the schedule. </p>
<h2>Schedule Management Approach</h2>
<p>            In addition to Project Charter for the basis of the project schedule, the scope management plan is also a factor to be added as additional inputs. The inputs are evaluated then defined into activities that will determine as the module of the project which must be performed for the succession of the project. The activities will be arranged into order as work packages and assign each activity relationship between project activities. Each of the activities have duration which the project team requires to estimate and calculate the number of work periods required to complete the activities as whole package. To create the project schedule, the team will be using Microsoft Project on creating the Gantt Chart of the project schedule. To oversee the project’s growth estimating the assign resources to the work packages in order for the project to be complete the schedule development.</p>
<p>Once an initial schedule has been created, the project team and the resources assigned to it will work on it cautiously assigned to project work packages in order to avoid the project’s schedule to be in critical path. The project team and assets must consent to the proposed work package task, duration of the activities, and the project schedule. Once this accomplish the project adviser will check then authorized the schedule after that then it will be baselined.</p>
<p>The following be assigned as points of reference or milestones for the project schedule:</p>
<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">

<p>Once the schedule is baselined as a major aspect of progressive elaboration, defining activities later may uncover new extension that was not envisaged previously. This ought to be taken care of through formal change control. Thus, change ask for is added to the is procedure as additional outputs. At the point when such changes are joined the plans and baselines will experience updates. The same are reflected as additional outputs. The development approach will altogether impact planning approach, evaluating methods, devices and how the schedule is managed and controlled.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Schedule Control</h2>
<p>            In order for the project team to control the schedule throughout of the lifetime of the project, the project schedule will be monitored, reviewed and revised when necessary whether a new or old information is added, deleted or updated. The project team members who accomplished the task will also be presenting the completion percentages that will be discuss to the project team.</p>
<p>            The project manager is responsible in managing schedule updates, meetings, and report as well as identifying the tasks that are scheduled for necessary modifications. Suggesting a schedule change requests and informing project schedule status to the stakeholder are also project manager's responsibilities.</p>
<p>            The project team is required in participating for the scheduled updates and meetings of the project. The project team are required to collaborate to any changes of the schedule from start-to-finish dates to the project manager and project adviser; and participating in schedule variance resolution as needed. The project manager will keep the project client updated of the project schedule status and the project client will review/approve any schedule request submitted by the project manager.</p>
<h2>Schedule Changes and Thresholds</h2>
<p>            When the project schedule is created by the project team, it is necessary that the project sponsor sets a limit to organize the schedule parameters wherein the project is anticipated to be finished or operational, this is important because it is necessary to align the project client visions and expectations to the actual project. One of the factors that could affect the changes in schedule is poor schedule management which will require an extension or change of project schedule. If there are any circumstances that may possibly affect the schedule which exceeds the limits set by the project sponsor, the project manager should submit a schedule change request and it should be approved by the project sponsor before the schedule change is made.</p>
<p>            The project manager will set a meeting with the project team to analyze and assess the change if any of the project team member concluded that an adjustment to the schedule is essential and an adjustment to the schedule is crucial to the succession of the project plan, the project manager, project team, project adviser, and the client must have a scheduled assessment meeting regarding the schedule adjustments. The project manager and the project team must decide which tasks will be affected by the potential change. A potential change and any alternative solutions activities must have materialized to see how they would affect the scope, schedule, and resources. After the analysis is completed, the project manager must resolve if any change will surpass the original schedule as planned or will go according to the schedule, then a schedule change request must be submitted.</p>
<p>Submittal of a schedule change request to the project stakeholder for approval is required if the following conditions is true:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The recommended change is reducing the duration or deliverables of an individual Sprint Backlog in developing phase in the project, or increasing the duration of individual Sprint Backlog by 10% or more, to clarify adding it to the duration not extending the work over all duration.</li>
	<li>Changes in the scope statement shall be considered to prevent inconsistencies in the documentation phase of the project. The project team must compile all the inconsistencies in the document before increasing the work packages by 5% or more to update the changes in all of documentation.</li>
	<li>Another approach to the change is either to reduce the duration of the overall project schedule by 10% or more, or increase the duration of the overall project schedule by 2% or more.</li>
</ul>
<p>            Any change request that do not comply meet these thresholds are still viable to submission to the project manager for approval. Once the change request has been reviewed and analyze by the project manager consulting first with the project adviser is recommended then discussing it with the project client is a must. After approving the change request, the project manager is responsible of adjusting the schedule and updating all the change and effects to the project team and client. The project manager must also ensure that all change requests are archived in the project records repository.</p>
<h2>Scope Change</h2>
<p>            If an issue is arising in the project that needs a drastic change in the project scope requesting a change is the best course action. The process for recommending and estimating the change to the scope of the project are cautiously must executed. Any project team member, or project client can request changes to the project scope. All change request must be submitted to the project advisor in the form of a project change request document. The project advisor will then analyze the suggested change to the scope of the project. The project advisor will then either reject the change request if it does not in line with the purpose of the project, or convene a Change Control meeting between the project team and client to review the change request further and perform an impact assessment of the change. If the change request receives initial approval by the project advisor and client, the project manager will communicate the scope change to all project team members’ then they will update all the necessary documents, deliverables, and product backlogs.</p>

=Quality Management Plan=
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            The Quality Management Plan for the Just-In-Time Logistics E-Commerce Website (JIT) project will establish the activities, processes, and procedures for ensuring a quality product upon the conclusion of the project.  The Quality Management Plan documents the important procedures and information required to effectively execute the project quality assurance from project planning to execution of the project. It defines the project’s quality approaches, strategies, criteria for and territories of usage, and function and obligations.</p>
<p>            During the Planning Phase of the project, The Quality Management Plan is developed and is considered as a core component of the Project Management Plan especially in Execution Phase. Its target group is the project manager, project team, project client, stakeholder, and project adviser whose support is expected to ensure quality is planned, define how quality will be managed, define quality assurance and control activities, and lastly, define acceptable quality standards.</p>
<h2>Quality Management Approach</h2>
<p>            The quality management approach for the JIT project will ensure quality is planned for both the product and processes.  In order to be successful, this project will meet its quality objectives by utilizing an integrated quality approach to define quality standards, measure quality and continuously improve quality. Website quality for the JIT project will be defined by the company’s current standards and criteria for its reliability, performance, and functionality of the website.  The focus is on the project’s deliverable and the standards and criteria being used will ensure the product meets established quality standards and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>            Process quality for the JIT project will focus on the processes by which the project deliverable will be developed.  Establishing process quality standards will ensure that all activities conform to an organizational standard which results in the successful delivery of the website.</p>
<p>            The project team will work with the Quality Group to define and document all organizational and project specific quality standards for both product and processes.  All quality documentation will become part of the JIT Project Plan and will be transitioned to operations upon the successful completion of the project.</p>
<p>            Metrics will be established and used to measure quality throughout the project life cycle for the product and processes.  The Quality Group Manager will be responsible for working with the project team to define these metrics, conduct measurements, and analyze results.  These product and process measurements will be used as one criterion in determining the success of the project and must be reviewed by the project sponsor.  Metrics will include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Schedule</li>
	<li>Resources</li>
	<li>Cost</li>
	<li>Process performance</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Automation of the Purchase to Distributor</li>
		<li>Automation of the Process to Logistics</li>
		<li>Timeliness</li>
		<li>Financial Performance</li>
		<li>Resource Effectiveness</li>
		<li>Marketing Sales Analytics</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Product performance</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Operability</li>
		<li>Performability</li>
		<li>Presentability</li>
		<li>Reliability</li>
		<li>Usability</li>
		<li>Accessibility</li>
		<li>Efficiency</li>
		<li>Interoperability</li>
		<li>Maintainability</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Customer Satisfaction (as a result of field trials)</li>
</ul>
<p>Quality improvements will be identified by any member of the project team or quality group.  Each recommendation will be reviewed to determine the cost versus benefit of implementing the improvement and how the improvement will impact the product or processes.  If an improvement is implemented the project manager will update all project documentation to include the improvement and the quality manager will update the organizational documentation the improvement affects.</p>
<h2>Quality Requirements / Standards</h2>
<p>            The objective of this sector is to support an accurate and quantifiable definition of Quality for JIT project. This definition is expressed as far as general Quality Factors, particular framework arranged Quality Criteria to be estimated for each factor, and measured quality targets and Quality metrics.</p>
<p>            The Quality Factors, Quality Criteria and Quality Metrics must be discussed in detail, right from the beginning of the project life cycle. Preceding to developing each JIT project component, the Quality Factors and Criteria must be evaluated to determine their relevance. Those variables and criteria deemed important must be considered as critical success factors for the component.</p>
<p><strong><em>Quality Factors:</em></strong></p>
<p>            Quality Factors are the user-perceived aspects of the JIT project components that conclude if JIT project meets user prerequisites.</p>
<p>The Table below presents the fundamental quality factors of JIT project. The table recognizes and depicts each issue, and positions the most elevated factors of components that are the indispensable Success Factors of the project</p>
<p>Note that the most imperative Quality Factor for JIT Project is Operability. This is Don Miguel Manabat's essential factor for deciding the quality of JIT Project. All other quality factors are subordinate to this objective.</p>

<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>            The quality assurance of the JIT project focuses on the processes used in the Services of the JIT Website.  In order to ensure quality, an iterative quality process will be used throughout the project life cycle.  This iterative process includes measuring process metrics, analyzing process data, and continuously improving the processes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The JIT Project Manager and the project team will perform assessments at planned intervals throughout the project to ensure all processes are being correctly implemented and executed.  Key performance metrics for the modules of the JIT Website include two Automation Process Factors of the Website. The established project tolerances for these metrics are the organizational standards for website development.</p>

<p>The quality manager will provide per module quality management and create a test plan per module on a weekly basis, monitor process performance metrics, and assure all processes comply with project and organizational standards.  If discrepancies are found, the quality manager will meet with the Project Manager and review the identified discrepancies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Project Manager will schedule regularly occurring project, management, and document reviews.  In these reviews, an agenda item will include a review of project processes, any discrepancies and/or audit findings from the quality manager, and a discussion on process improvement initiatives. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Process improvement is another aspect of quality assurance.  Quality assurance reviews, findings, and assessments should always result in some form of process improvement and, as a result, product improvement.  All process improvement efforts must be documented, implemented, and communicated to all stakeholders as changes are made.</p>
<h2>Quality Control</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>            The quality control of the JIT project focuses primarily on the JIT project and the acceptable standards and performance.  The quality performance standards for the JIT project are in accordance with the organizational standards of performance of a website.  However, there are several project-specific quality standards which were established specifically for the JIT project. The suggested innovation to the JIT project will be submitted to the quality management which will be analyzed and tested whether the modules meet the requirements of the expected performance. Additionally, all test cases will be conducted on each module to ensure compliance with established quality standards.  The table below illustrates all the quality criteria for the JIT Project:</p>

=Human Resource Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            Human resources management is a plan for JIT Project that guides the project team assigning roles and responsibilities of the team member in human resources activities stated in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) which covers the start until the closure of the project. The human resource management plan includes:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Roles and Responsibilities of the team member whether the members are tasked in quality, documents, development, etc.</li>
	<li>Project Organization Charts that visualizes the activities and the member assigned to the activity that also measures the allotted time in the activity.</li>
	<li>Staffing management plan should state:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>What type of staff should be included in the project?</li>
	<li>Training requirements in the project</li>
	<li>Timeline for resources/skill sets</li>
	<li>How performance should be evaluated?</li>
	<li>What types of motivation should be used?</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>The purpose of the human resource management plan is to determine which of the methods of staffing in a website development project should be aligned with the project objectives. This includes appropriate human resources with skill sets that are required in the project if any gaps in skills such as collaborating, or communications are identified, team building strategies are clearly defined and team activities are effectively managed.</p>
<h2><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong></h2>
<p>            The roles and responsibilities are required and must be laid out for this project success. All team members that are included in the list must clearly understand their responsibilities that are assigned to them to successfully perform their part of the project. The JIT Project listed the required personnel for the project and their responsibilities have been established:</p>
<p><strong>Project Manager (PM), (1 position): </strong>responsible for the decision and communications for the overall success of the JIT Project. The PM roles decide whether to authorize and approve of all project expenditures. The PM is also responsible for monitoring the work activities and team member performance meet established acceptability criteria and fall within acceptable variance. The PM will be responsible for monitoring the JIT Project status in accordance with the communications management plan. The PM will monitor and evaluate the performance of all project team members and report their performance to the functional managers. The PM will give the final verdict of acquiring human resources for the project through coordination with functional managers. The PM will handle the relationship, scheduling, budgeting, communications, and overall decision for the project.</p>
<p><strong>Document Analyst (DA), (1 position): </strong>responsible for organizing and documenting the project charter, business case, stakeholder strategy, scope, cost, schedule, quality, human resources, communications, procurement, risk, and implementation management plan. They will handle if there are any changes in one of the important documents. They are most active members of the project team because they need to confer with the project manager and other team members such as quality analyst and developers through documents. They are also responsible for editing and proofreading documents for grammar, correct spelling, and clarity of the documents. They will be required to interview project team members regarding existing documents, so they could improve upon, modify, and enhance JIT Project literature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Financial Consultant (FC), (1 position):</strong> is an external position or member that is responsible for offering information and guidance on topics that include taxes, investments, and cost-benefit decisions for the JIT Project Management. The consultant does not necessarily join the team throughout the project but only during the planning phase of the JIT Project Management to offer personalized financial advice. The consultant may also direct to the client negotiating the cost management relation to the schedule of the JIT Project. The consultant will meet personally with the JIT Team members and client to assess their financial situation to present a financial plan that cover the duration of the project term and after the project term. The consultant may also help the JIT Project team with the staffing of the team members.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Digital Designer (Digi Art), (1 position):</strong> responsible for leading and producing the design function for the JIT Project. The position is also responsible for delivering effective, aesthetic, original brand, and on-strategy designs for the JIT Project’s website graphics, logo including photographs that are related to the JIT Project, advertisements, email templates, social media designs, and banned ads.

<h2>Staffing Management</h2>
<h2>Staff Acquisition:</h2>
<p>            For the JIT Project, the project staff will consist of three teams; the Project Management Team, Development Team, and Quality Team. The planning stage is where the project team would outsource and contract members or external entities that would aid the project team to success. The Project Manager will negotiate with the functional leaders in the team to identify required skills and resources that must be allocated in accordance with the project management structure. All staff and resources must be approved by the relevant functional leader before the staff and resources may begin any project work. The project team will share location of the project to ensure the consistency throughout the whole project.</p>
<h2>Resource Calendars:  </h2>
<p>            The JIT Project development will last for ten months including the planning, quality testing, and closeout documents. All resources must be identified and evaluated before the project can start. The resources histogram illustrates that the project team are split into three teams mainly Project Management, Development, and Quality team. They are required to perform between specific times to complete a task assigned to the team which explains the shift in the required hours each month. The Project Management Team required to perform 8 hours a day which will accumulate to 185 hours per month within the one to two months and nine to ten months of JIT Project. The job of Project Management is to guide the other teams on the tasks assigned to them.</p>
<p>            The Project Development Team is required to perform 8 hours a day and 185 hours per month within the three months to eight months of JIT Project Development since within this time they are the one developing the JIT Project. After the required months the required hours will begin to lessen. The Quality Management team has the most inconsistent required of hours because they need an output first before performing their task. In the first three months of the JIT Project they don’t have any hours of required at all since they do not have any work assigned to them yet. After three months, they are required to perform at least four to five hours of time. During the last two months, the required time begins to increase.</p>

<h2>Training:</h2>
<p>There is no training schedule with regards to the JIT Project since the Project Management outsource staff has the required skills sets. However, if training requirements are identified, funding will be provided from the project reserve.</p>
<h2>Performance Reviews:  </h2>
<p>Before releasing project resources, the project manager will review other team leader’s evaluation report of their member’s assigned work activities at the onset of the project and communicate all expectations of work to be performed. The project manager will then evaluate the performance of each team member throughout the project to see how effectively they are completing their assigned work.</p>

=Work Breakdown Structure=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            The Work Breakdown Structure is breakdown of all the work packages necessary to complete, presented here represents all the work required to complete this project. A WBS is constructed Outline View Structure to develop to easily navigate and understand the structure how to accomplish this project, it also represents the work identified in the approved Project Scope Statement and serves as an Initial Schedule Development and Cost Estimating. We do the WBS is help more accurately and specifically define and organize the scope of the whole project. Also, to help with assigning responsibilities, resource allocation, monitoring and controlling the project.</p>

<h2>Glossary of Terms </h2>
<p><strong>Scrum</strong> – is a process encourages practitioners to work with what they have and continually evaluate what is working and what is not working. Communication, which is an important part of the process, is carried out through meetings, called Events. Sprint Planning Meeting - a sprint refers to the time frame in which work must be completed, and it's often 30 days. Everyone participates in setting the goals, and at the end, at least one increment -- a usable piece of software -- should be produced.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint Review</strong> - this is the time to show off the increment. Sprint Retrospective - is a meeting that's held after a Sprint ends. During this meeting, everyone reflects on the Sprint process. A team-building exercise may also be offered. An important goal of a Sprint Retrospective is continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint backlog</strong> - is a list of tasks that must be completed before selected product backlog items can be delivered. These are divided in to time-based user stories.</p>
<p><strong>Product increment</strong> - refers to what's been accomplished during a Sprint -- all the product backlog items as well as what's been created during all previous Sprints. The product increment reflects how much progress has been made.</p>

<p><strong>Risk management</strong> - is the process of identifying, assessing and controlling threats to an organization's capital and earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Project Charter</strong> - is a formal, typically short document that describes your project in its entirety including what the objectives are, how it will be carried out, and who the stakeholders are.</p>
<p>Level of Effort:       Level of Effort (LOE) is how much work is required to complete a task.</p>
<p>WBS Code:              A unique identifier assigned to each element in a Work Breakdown Structure for designating the elements hierarchical location within the WBS.</p>
<p>Work Package:         A Work Package is a deliverable or work component at the lowest level of its WBS branch.</p>
<p>WBS Component:    A component of a WBS which is located at any level.  It can be a Work Package or a WBS Element as there's no restriction on what a WBS Component is.</p>
<p>WBS Element:         A WBS Element is a single WBS component and its associated attributes located anywhere within a WBS.  A WBS Element can contain work, or it can contain other WBS Elements or Work Packages.</p>

=Procurement Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	The procurement Management plan sets the plans for obtaining requirements for the development to closure. It will serve as a guide for managing obtaining requirements in the JIT Project and will updated if there are any changes in the plan that involves acquisition of requirements. This plan identifies the related technologies to be obtain as listed in the requirements as well as the justification why would it require and when should the technologies should be obtained. This plan also identifies the type of contract to be used, risk associated with procurement management, of course, includes a mitigation plan, determining the cost the procured technologies and how are the JIT Project are going to used it, how multiple suppliers will be managed, contract approval process, decision criteria. This plan would layout how critical procurement and contracts are coordinated with the JIT&rsquo;s Project scope, budget, and schedule or any constraints relevant to procurement, and performance metrics for the procurement activities. This also includes the identification of the sellers.
</p>
<h2>Procurement Management Approach</h2>
<p>
	The Project Manager will oversight and manage for all procurement activities in JIT Project. The Project manager will collaborate with the project team to identify all technologies that are required to procure for the succession of the JIT project. The Meeting will be held to be reviewed the list of procurement as well as description why the JIT Project Management would need them prior to submitting it to the contracts and purchasing department. The result of the meeting would determine whether the list of procurements is valid and reasonable to make or buy the items, then it will start selecting stores, bidding, purchasing, and the contracting process.
</p>
<h2>Cost Determination and Procurement Definition</h2>
<p>
	The JIT Project Management will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to obtain proposal from numerous services which will describe the advantages of their services to meet the JIT Project Requirements and the cost of the subscription. All the proposal must include the vendors services of Host Server Capabilities, Security, Performance, and the Subscription Cost. The Vendor must outline how the service should be rendered, who are the personnel the service, the vendor&rsquo;s experience in providing customer support from the service, Customer feedbacks, Background of the employees performing the service, and a line-service breakdown of all cost. Additionally, the vendors will be required to submit work breakdown structures (WBSs) and work schedules to show their understanding of the work to be performed and their ability to meet the project schedule.
</p>
<p>
	All information must be included in each proposal as the proposals will be used as the foundation of our selection criteria. Proposals which omit solicited information or contain incomplete information will be discarded from consideration.
</p>
<p>
	The following list of items or services, justification, and timeline are the identified items that is essential to complete the JIT Project. Note that the table is the list of items waiting for approval of the Project Management for them to review and analyze.

<p>
	Development Leader
</p>
<p>
	Project Client
</p>
<p>
	Project Adviser
</p>
<p>
	Project Director
</p>
<h2>Type of Contract to be Used</h2>
<p>
	All services to be procured for the JIT Project will be requested through Time and Material contracts (T&amp;M). The JIT Project Management decided T&amp;M because most of the procured are services subscription. Additionally, the JIT Project requires to have a research and development to ensure that the JIT Project will improve the state of business as per stated in the scope. The Project Management will work with the contracts and purchasing department to define the subscription types, plans, services, and customer support. The Project Management will search services available online from various stores to procure the service within the required period and at a reasonable cost under the T&amp;M once the service is selected.
</p>
<h2>Procurement Risks</h2>
<p>All procurement activities also have potential risk attach to them which the JIT Project must anticipate and prepare a backup plan or mitigation plan to ensure that project is still on the schedule. While all risk will be list down and managed in the JIT Project&rsquo;s Risk Management Plan, there are specific risk that are risk or problem to procurement which must be considered:</p>
<ul>
<ul>Weather conditions expectations of having unstable connection.</ul>
<ul>Internet connection service failure.</ul>
<ul>Poor Customer Service</ul>
<ul>Security Breach of Services</ul>
<ul>Questionable past service performance</ul>
<ul>Conflicts with current contracts and store relationships</ul>
<ul>Unrealistic service and cost expectations for vendors</ul>
<ul>Configuration management for upgrades and improvements of purchased technology</ul>
<ul>Potential service failure and impacts on cost and schedule</ul>
<ul>Potential that final product does not meet required specifications</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	The list does not cover all the potential risk in the service therefore standard risk management process of identifying, documenting, analyzing, mitigating, and managing risks will be used.
</p>

<h2>Procurement Risk Management</h2>
<p>
	The JIT Project Risk Management plan stated that all project risk involved with the JIT Project will be managed. However, for the risk related to procurement, there must be additional consideration since the vendors are not part of the JIT Project Management but as a third-party organization and potentially affect current and future business relationship as well as the internal service business operations. Because of these facts, The JIT Project Management will include the representative from the contracting department in all procurement meetings and status reviews.
</p>
<h2>Standardized Procurement Documentation</h2>
<p>
	The Project Management must utilize the cost and resource of the Project as well as to simplify the procurement management mean to facilitate successful completion of the contract and project. The JIT Project Management will use standard documentation for all the steps for the procurement process. Due to the reason that it provides adequate levels of detail which allows for easier comparison of proposal, more accurate pricing, more detailed responses and more efficient management of contract and vendors.
</p>
<p>
	The following standard documents will be used for project procurement activities:
</p>
<ul>
	<ul>
		Standard Request for Proposal Template to include
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<ul>
		Background
	</ul>
	<ul>

	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<ul>
		Internal source selection evaluation forms
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Non-disclosure agreement
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Letter of intent
	</ul>

		Procurement audit form
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Procurement performance evaluation form
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Lessons learned form
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Procurement Constraints</h2>
<p>
	There are several constraints that must be considered as part of the project&rsquo;s procurement management plan. These constraints will be included in the RFP and communicated to all vendors to determine their ability to operate within these constraints. These constraints apply to several areas which include schedule, cost, scope, resources, and technology:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		Schedule:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		Project schedule of procurement activities, contract administration, and contract fulfillment is must be established in the JIT Project Management. Any request of changes with these activities must go through the process of change control.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		If any risk occurred, it must be mitigate as soon as possible using the mitigation plan created for the procurement. Any request of change schedule and budget must go through the process of JIT Project Schedule Management.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Cost:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		Project budget has contingency and management reserves built in; however, these reserves may not be applied to procurement activities. Reserves are only to be used in the event of an approved change in project scope or at management&rsquo;s discretion.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Since the procured services can be procured at the close out of the JIT Project Management, specifically the turn-over of the Website. If there is any delay occurred, it can be ignored and change the schedule.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Scope:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		All the procured services must be justified to what cause would the JIT Project to have gain in said services. All the procurement activities must comply to the JIT Project scope such as the target budget, efficiency of the Website, etc., if there are any activities that does not relate to the project scope will be identified as out of scope.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Resources:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		All procured services are within the planned budget therefore must be perform and manage by the project manager accordingly to the plan. There will be no additional personnel to manage the activities nor re-allocated to support the procurement activities on this project.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Technology:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		The services have already been identified by the project team and will be included in the statemen of work as part of the RFP. While the vendor&rsquo;s&rsquo; proposal may include suggestion or alternative to the procured services but must keep in mind that it will be same service in the statement of work.
	</ul>

<h2>Decision Criteria</h2>
<p>
	The criteria for the selection and award of procurement contracts under this project will be based on the following decision criteria:
</p>
<ul>
	<ul>
		Vendor&rsquo;s Customer Support
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Performance
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Quality
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Cost
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Comparison of outsourced cost versus in-sourcing
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Past performance
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	These criteria will be measured by the Project Manager. The ultimate decision will be made based on these criteria as well as available resources.
</p>

<h2>Vendor Management</h2>
<p>
	The Project Manager is responsible for searching for the vendors as well as managing them. The Project Manager and the vendor will meet weekly with the contract and each vendor will discuss the services they offer and status. The meeting can be in person or by telecommunications. The purpose of the meetings to have an agreement between the vendor and the project manager because the project manager will inspect the service whether is good or not. This also will give the project manager whether the service is capable enough to comply with the project requirements establish in the project objectives. It also serves as an opportunity to ask questions. The project manager will be responsible for scheduling this meeting until the end of the contract.
</p>
<h2>Performance Metrics for Procurement Activities</h2>
<p>
	While the Subscribing and contracts department has their own internal metrics for procurement, the following metrics are established for vendor performance for this project&rsquo;s procurement activities. Each metric is rated on a 1-3 scale as indicated below:
</p>
<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">

=Risk Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            The JIT Project Management anticipated that risk and uncertainty of event that comes along with developing new and unique project. That said, the JIT Project Management takes advantage of the anticipated results by creating Risk Management Plan. The purpose of the Risk Management Plan is to establish the framework in which the JIT Project team will identify risk and developing strategies to counter act or avoid those risk. However, before risk can be identified and managed, there are preliminary project elements which must be completed. These elements are outlined in the risk management approach.</p>
<p>This project is considered a high-risk project as its function is to be the main transaction for the company of MC Manabat. The project’s function involves money transaction and confidential information transfer between the process of the JIT Project’s website, so the security of the website must be tested and check regularly to avoid implications within the business.</p>
<p>Before risk management begins it is imperative that a foundation is established for providing structured project information, thus, the following project elements were completed and defined prior to developing this Risk Management Plan:</p>
<ul>
	<ul><strong>Scope, Schedule, and Cost Management Plan must first be established to include:</strong></ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>Estimation of JIT Project cost and finalization of budget.</ul>
		<ul>Established Performance Metric System</ul>
		<ul>Identify the Work Modules of the JIT Project</ul>
		<ul>Identify the available Resources for the Project.</ul>
		<ul>Established a Work Schedule relative to the Work Modules.</ul>
		<ul>Developer Project WBS/WBS Dictionary.</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul><strong>Define the scope and limitation of the following:</strong></ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>Schedule Management Plan</ul>
		<ul>Cost Management Plan</ul>
		<ul>Quality Management Plan</ul>
		<ul>Stakeholder Management Plan</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<ul><strong>Define Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities</strong></ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>Project Manager chairs the risk assessment meetings</ul>
		<ul>Project team participates in risk assessment meetings and members serve as meeting recorder and timekeeper</ul>
		<ul>Key stakeholders participate in risk assessment meetings</ul>
		<ul>Project Adviser may participate in risk assessment meetings</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Top Three Risks</h2>
<p>The top three high probability and high impact risks to The JIT Project are:</p>
<p><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></p>
<p>Due to the Internet of things gradually growing more of the securities are breach and it is important to the JIT Project especially dealing with money transaction to prevent or create a mitigation plan when event happens. The project manager will ensure that the risk of prevent or mitigate authorized person to hi-jack or acquire confidential information in the JIT Project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Time Management</strong></p>
<p>Due to the uncertainty of event that the Project Management assumes that will happen throughout the Project that will result in delaying of the project schedule as well as wasting resources for the JIT Project requires a plan of action of the process that will happen in case a problem event occurs. The Project Manager will mitigate the risk for the problems that will happen in the future and will have a back-up plan a ready.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Consistency of the Project </strong></p>
<p>Due to ineffective methodology and practice can lead the Project Management to have a risk in the Consistency of the project that will result in unintentional change of plans in the Project that will lead a dissatisfaction and disappointment of the Project Stakeholders and Client of the project. The project manager will mitigate the risk and it will require the members to adjust so that the Project Management will use as the standard practice.</p>
<h2>Risk Management Approach</h2>
<p>            The risk analysis regarding information systems that JIT Project Management have taken approach to manage risk for this project which the Project Management identified and ranked the various risks. The Project Team prioritize the highest impact risk were added to project schedule to ensure that the risk would minimize its probability of becoming a problem as well as taking the necessary precaution to implement the mitigation response plan at the appropriate time. Team leaders assigned in the risk management will inform status updates on their assigned risks and must be updated weekly by having the meetings with the project manager, but only when the meetings include their risk’s planned timeframe. Before the completion of the project, during closing process, the project manager will analyze the risk as well as the process to it. Based on the analysis, the project manager will identify any improvements that can be added to the risk management process for the Project Client to know as part of the maintenance of the website after the turnover has happened.</p>
<h2><strong>Risk Identification</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>            For the JIT Project, risk analysis method used by the Project team to identify risk is Qualitative Risk Analysis. The risk assessment meeting representatives discuss and create scenarios that outline the potential threats to the business and rank these threats according to the severity of the potential problems if it occurred. The procedure writing scenarios for the major risk, estimating the effects of event, if it happened, and creating a counter measures and safeguards against the event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Simulation Test</strong></p>
<p>One Security Analyst (SA) is involved in the project. The SA will simulate cyber-attack against the JIT Project to test the website whether the penetration of the SA will be successful, or the website would safely be unaffected by the attack. The result will be documented, and the JIT Project will be improved based on the comments and suggestion of the SA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reserve Funds</strong></p>
<p>A risk assessment meeting discussing allocating resources for uncertainty of events and must be only used when occurrence of the problem arises in the project management.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Daily Team Meeting</strong></p>
<p>Each team leader must discuss the status of their members about work assigned to them, what are the issues that they encounter, what solutions they need to work on, and what they will do for the day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risk Assessment Meeting</strong></p>
<p>A risk assessment meeting was held with key team leaders and stakeholders. The risks identified during this meeting were added to the project plan and Risk Table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Historical Review of Similar Projects</strong></p>
<p>The project team reviewed the history of similar projects to determine the most common risks and the strategies used to mitigate those risks.</p>

<h2>Risk Qualification and Prioritization</h2>
<p>            To determine the severity of the risk that will be identified by the team, a probability and impact was used as metric to the assigned risk. This process allowed the team leaders and project manager to prioritize risk based on the severity of the effect that the risk would have on the project. The project manager utilized a probability-impact matric to manage the team leader in moving each risk to the appropriate place on the table. Once the risks were assigned a probability and impact and placed in the appropriate position on the table, documenting the finished website and the project manager moved the process on to the next step: risk mitigation/avoidance planning.</p>
<h2>Risk Monitoring</h2>
<p>            The project schedules an assigned team member for each risk. During the daily meeting between leaders and members is assigned for each risk. The meeting will discuss the status of their work and as well as the risk associated to it. There will be a discussion of risk if the team member is assigned to do the work module with risk probability to it. Risk monitoring will be a continuous process throughout the life of the JIT Project. As risk approach on the JIT project the project manager will check the team leader’s status report of risk management of their members as well as the leaders with necessary status updates which include the risk status, identification of trigger conditions, and the documentation of the risk response.</p>
<h2>Risk Mitigation and Avoidance</h2>
<p>            The project manager ensures to aid team leader in developing and improving responses to each identified risk. As more risk are identified, if the risk is qualified based on the metric established, the team has to respond to develop avoidance and mitigation strategies to the risk. The identified risk will be also added to the risk register or in the table and the project plan to ensure that they are monitored when the work involves those risk.</p>
<p>            The risk for the JIT Project will be managed and controlled within the constraints of schedule, authority, and budget cost. All identified risk will be analyzed to determine how the risk will impact the time, scope, cost. The project manager with the assistance of the project team experts will determine the efficient way to deal with each risk to ensure that everything goes according to plan. There will be cases that it will be necessary to allow the project to extend its budget cost. If only necessary to allow the JIT Project for more resources to meet the deadline and requirements of the JIT project.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Register</strong></p>
<p>            The Risk Register is a log or list of all identified risk of the JIT Project. The list consists of risk description of their probability and impact, the category they belong to, mitigation strategy, and what event would trigger them. The risk register was identified in the project management meeting led by the project manager. During this meeting, the project team identified that there is a need of creating a risk management plan that the project team categorized each risk. In addition, the team assigned each risk will prioritize according to the probability and impact of the risk it could potentially have. The risk register also describes the mitigation strategy on each risk.</p>
<p>The identified risk in the risk register, each risk has been classified and added to the project plan. When the work module contains a risk—prior to when the risk is going to occur—the project manager will assign a leader to ensure adherence to the agreed mitigation strategy. Each assigned leader will provide the status of the risk relevant to their group in their daily project meeting.</p>

=Communication Management Plan=

<h2>Introductions</h2>
<p>The reason of creating a Communications Management Plan is for the project team to determine what are the communication requirements for the project and how information will be delivered. Communications Management Plan will be the one setting the scheme for the communications of the project, it will serve as a guide for the project team members throughout the duration of the project and it will only be changed or updated when needed. It also determines and describe the roles of persons involved in the project.</p>
<h2>Communication Management Approach</h2>
<p>The project manager will be the one responsible in ensuring effective communications on this project. The project manager will be allocating most of his time looking out for the project and reporting the performance of the project to the project team members and stakeholders, he will also be responsible organizing meeting, creating the project plan, constructing and reading emails, meeting with his project team members and managing the work being performed by them.</p>
<p>By having a good communication management approach a lot of project management problems can be prevented.</p>
<h2>Communication Management Constraints</h2>
<p>            Every project is no exception to limitation and constraints because they must be within the scope of the project and comply with its budget, scheduling and resource necessity. So the project planning and documentation is also limited and constrained. There must be an administrative or organizational policy requirements that must be followed as part of communications management and these constraints must be clearly discussed to all the project stakeholders and make sure that all of them have understood.</p>
<p>            All activities in the project communication will appear within the project’s approved budget, schedule and resource allocations. The one who will be responsible in ensuring that all communication activities are performed by the project team without external resources that may affect the budget and exceed the authorized budget is the project manager.</p>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<p>Roles and responsibilities for schedule development are as follows:</p>
