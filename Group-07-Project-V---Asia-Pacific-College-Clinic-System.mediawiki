<p>The APC Medical Clinic is a healthy facility under the institution, Asia Pacific College, that provides medical services to students. These services can include physical and mental health care and are provided by a professionally prepared school nurse which is Ms. Ana Mae Torre along with APC’s affiliated Doctor and Dentist.
</p>

=Business Case=
==Executive Summary==
==Issue==
<p>The current system of Asia Pacific College’s Clinic for managing health records and inventory is inefficient and time-consuming because of this it is negatively impacting the efficiency and effectiveness of the health services we provide to the students and faculty. The process of managing physical records is consuming valuable clinic space and is prone to errors, while the lack of a scheduling system has resulted in walk-in patients and long queues, creating an unsatisfactory experience for patients. The process for generating summary reports of services is also time-consuming and requires significant manual effort. Additionally, the current communication process for notifying students of appointment cancellations is inadequate, leading to confusion and frustration among our student population. To address these issues and improve the overall management of health records, scheduling, and communication, it is necessary to implement a new and improved system that will streamline these processes, reduce errors, and enhance the overall experience to not only the patients but also the clinic.</p>

==Anticipated Outcomes==
<p>The proposed project to digitize the health record system and add a scheduling system is expected to result in significant improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of the health services provided by the APC clinic. By implementing features such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for health records, the system will provide a faster and more accurate management of health records generated by the clinic's services such as student physical check-ups, dental examinations, consultations, first aid, and emergency treatment. The new system will enable clinic staff to easily access and update patient records, reducing the time required for record-keeping and allowing for more efficient patient care.
<br><br>
The addition of a scheduling system with a table and calendar view of appointment schedules will allow users to manage their appointments, avoiding scheduling conflicts and reducing wait times easily and efficiently for walk-in patients. As a result, the overall experience for students and faculty using the clinic's services is expected to improve significantly, leading to increased satisfaction and a higher level of trust in the clinic's ability to provide quality care. Furthermore, the digitization of health records will allow for easier sharing of information with other medical providers, as well as a more secure and efficient system for storing and accessing records. The project is anticipated to result in a more streamlined and effective health record and scheduling system, improving the clinic's ability to provide high-quality health services to its student population, and enabling the clinic to better serve the healthcare needs of the campus community.
</p>


==Recommendation==
<p>
Based on the analysis of the current health record and scheduling system, it is recommended that Asia Pacific College invest in a new digitized health record and scheduling system. This new system will eliminate physical records, free up valuable clinic space, and enable easier sharing of information with other medical providers. In addition, the implementation of a scheduling system with a table and calendar view of appointment schedules will reduce wait times for patients and improve the overall experience for students.
<br><br>
While SMS notification was not implemented due to budget constraints, it is recommended that APC implement it, if possible, to further improve patient experience and streamline communication with students regarding their appointments. Despite this limitation, the recommended investment in this project is still expected to result in significant improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of the health services provided by Asia Pacific College's clinic, leading to increased satisfaction and a higher level of trust in the clinic's ability to provide quality care. Therefore, it is recommended that Asia Pacific College move forward with the proposed project and allocate the necessary resources to ensure its successful implementation.
</p>


==Justification==
<p>The proposed project to digitize the health record system and add a scheduling system is necessary to address the current inefficiencies and limitations in the clinic's health record and scheduling processes. The current system is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to long wait times for walk-in patients, physical records that consume valuable clinic space, and a lack of timely communication with students regarding appointment cancellations. The absence of a scheduling system has resulted in an unmanageable queue of patients and has caused students to walk in for their physical and dental check-ups, which is not an optimal solution. Furthermore, the manual process of generating summary reports of services is time-consuming, which detracts from the quality of patient care and limits the clinic's ability to respond to the healthcare needs of the campus community.
<br><br>
The proposed project will address these issues by providing faster and more efficient management of health records generated by the clinic's services, such as student physical check-ups, dental examinations, consultations, first aid, emergency treatment. The digitization of health records will eliminate the need for physical records and free up valuable clinic space while enabling easier sharing of information with other medical providers. The addition of a scheduling system will reduce wait times for patients and provide a more efficient way of managing appointments, avoiding scheduling conflicts and improving the overall experience for students. These improvements are expected to lead to increased satisfaction and a higher level of trust in the clinic's ability to provide quality care, enhancing the reputation of the clinic and the university.

==Problem Definition==
<p> <b>Problem Statement</b></p>
<p>Asia Pacific College’s Clinic is encountering problems when it comes to handling patient records, that includes managing and organizing the records due that the current method they are using on making the records are through traditional means of pen and paper. This kind of method can be prone to human error or data loss as paper type record can be vulnerable to damages from accidents such as water spill, crumpling, and misplacement. This is also relevant for the inventory record as they need to manually update the clinic’s inventory to track the items being distributed to the patient in need.
<br><br>
One thing the clinic staff is concerned about is the number of people who will undergo medical exams during the enrollment period, as Asia Pacific College clinic only has a small amount of workforce and can be overrun by the people. This can cause delays for the people who wish to enroll.</p>


<p><b>Organizational Impact</b></p>
<p>The implementation of this project could have a significant impact on the clinic of Asia Pacific College as it will allow the staff to organize the records and reduce the time spent looking for specific data. This also reduces the staff's workload and organizes the queuing of patients coming to the clinic. Overall, this project will be able to digitize the clinic of Asia Pacific College, making their work more efficient without overthinking that much on human-related errors.</p>

<p><b>Technology Migration</b></p>
<p>The migration process of existing physical records will undergo scanning by the staff, while the database will be integrated into Asia Pacific College’s Database.</p>

==Project Overview==
<p><b>Project Description</b></p>
<p>The goal of the project is to digitize the handling of health records in Asia Pacific College’s clinic, that would allow the staff to monitor, organize, and update the said records. As well as having an appointment system to control the patient’s queue, avoiding the time consumed for the patient side as well as minimizing the crowd that will fall in line in the clinic. This will also provide an inventory system where the clinic staff can monitor the stock of medicine and ask for a requisition request when needed.<p>

<p><b>Goals and Objectives</b></p>
<p>E-Cliniq aims to automate the record-keeping processes and add an appointment system to Asia Pacific College’s clinic, which would improve the efficiency and handling time of processes. This system addresses the common business problem of unorganized queues, manual record-keeping, and inventory management, which can lead to human errors. By implementing the system, the school’s clinic can achieve the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lessen the time when fetching health records from the tables in the system</li>
  <li>Migrate 100% of patient records to a digital database integrated to the existing database of Asia Pacific College.</li>
  <li>Inventory of medicine would be tracked digitally for restocking and management.</li>
  <li>Provide a way to schedule appointments online which will also give notifications</li>
  <li>Provide user training to the clinic staff to ensure effective implementation and adoption of the system.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Project Performance</b></p>
<p>The system project will be considered successful if it achieves the following performance metrics:<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Quick fetching of records and security of records:</b> This could be measured by the seconds it will take to search for a health record compared to searching for it in the filing cabinets.</li>
  <li><b>Reduction of paper used:</b>This could be measured when the health records are migrated 100% to the digital database integrated into the existing database of Asia Pacific College.</li>
  <li><b>Decrease inventory management time:</b>This could be measured by the seconds it will take to manage the inventory compared to the hours it will take to manually count all the stocks.</li>
  <li><b>Better appointment experience:</b>This could be measured through how many people will queue in a day compared to how many people walk in when there was no appointment system implemented.</li>
  <li><b>Effective implementation: </b> This could be measured by comparing the cost of maintaining the integrated platform compared to efficiency of it.</li>
  <li><b>User adoption:</b> This could be measured by the percentage of users actively using the integrated system.</li>

To enable modular and flexible development, our team will use microservices architecture. The system will be housed on a trustworthy and safe cloud platform, making it accessible from any location in the world. To secure the system from online dangers and unauthorized access, we will also employ best-in-class security measures.</p>

<p>The system will be housed on an exceptionally reliable and safe cloud platform (AWS), making it available from any location in the world. The developers will also employ top-notch security measures to guard the system against online dangers and unwanted access.
The E-Cliniq project's technical architecture is built to guarantee the application's effectiveness, dependability, and security. The architecture is client-server based.Using an application server as the server and a web browser as the client.</p>

<p>The system shall be developed using PHP and MySQL server with Laravel for its framework. The user interface of the E-Cliniq system is designed with PHP. The developers studied the Laravel framework to design the system.</p>


=Project Management Plans=
==Stakeholders Strategy Management Plan==
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>This Stakeholder Management Plan aims to provide a comprehensive and practical framework for effectively managing the E-Cliniq project's stakeholders. The implementation of E-Cliniq is dependent on the cooperation and support of all stakeholders involved. Stakeholder management is an integral part of the project management process, and identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing stakeholders is essential for project success.</p>

<p>The objective of the E-Cliniq Stakeholder Management Plan is to ensure that all stakeholders are identified, engaged, and effectively managed throughout the project lifecycle. These are the objectives of this plan:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identify all stakeholders involved in or affected by the E-Cliniq project and assess their level of interest, influence, and impact.</li>
	<li>Establish effective communication channels with project stakeholders to ensure that they are informed, consulted, and included in project-related decision-making processes.</li>
	<li>To develop and implement a plan for stakeholder engagement that will guarantee the support and buy-in of all stakeholders.</li>
	<li>Anticipate and effectively manage any stakeholder resistance, conflict, or competing objectives.</li>
	<li>To monitor and evaluate stakeholder engagement throughout the project lifecycle and make any necessary adjustments to guarantee project success.</li>
</ul>

<p>Effective stakeholder management can yield numerous benefits for the E-Cliniq project, including improved project outcomes, decreased risks, increased stakeholder satisfaction, and an enhanced reputation.</p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p>Identification of every stakeholder who will be reached by the project is essential. Stakeholder identification, according to the IEEE Standards Association (2019), is the process of identifying all people or organizations who will be impacted by the project or have the potential to influence its result. The ability to manage stakeholder expectations, reduce negative effects, and secure stakeholder buy-in is why effective stakeholder identification is essential to project success. To identify stakeholders, apply the technique below:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Stakeholder Mapping: This method entails identifying stakeholders, comprehending their requirements, interests, and concerns, and mapping them according to their level of involvement and impact with the project. You can carry out this process by:
		<ul>
			<li>Creating a stakeholder list: This entails compiling a list of all prospective stakeholders, both internal and external, who may be influenced by the project.
			</li>

			<li>Stakeholder analysis: This entails determining the stakeholders' level of interest, influence, and impact on the project's success. An interest-power grid or stakeholder matrix can be used to conduct the study.
			</li>
				
			<li>Prioritizing stakeholders: In this step, stakeholders are ranked according to their level of involvement, interest in the project, and possible effect on its outcome.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	Engagement of StakeholdersAfter the stakeholders have been identified, the following step is to involve them in all phases of the project. This entails:
		<ul>
			<li>Creating a stakeholder engagement strategy that describes how the project team will interact with each stakeholder, what information they will share, and how they will manage stakeholder expectations.
			</li>

			<li>Creating communication channels that includes developing ways for the project team to efficiently communicate with stakeholders.
			</li>
				
			<li>Maintaining stakeholder involvement entails being in touch with stakeholders throughout the course of the project, giving them regular updates, and attending to any issues they might have.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

=Scope Management Plan=

==Introduction==
<p>The Scope Management Plan for E-Cliniq is an essential component of the project that defines the project's objectives, deliverables, and constraints; it will be updated throughout the project to ensure clear communication and scope management. The project team will collaborate closely with project stakeholders to assure delivery success that is in line with the project's scope and limitations.</p>

<p><b>Scope Definition:</b>The scope of the E-Cliniq will be defined through the following activities:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Requirements gathering: </b>The project team will collect and record system requirements using a number of methodologies, including user interviews and group discussions.</li>
  <li><b>User Stories:</b> The project team will construct user stories that outline the system's functionality from the end user's perspective. These user stories will be prioritized according to their business importance and used to direct the development process.</li>
  <li><b>Scope statement:</b>Inputs such as user stories and requirements will be used to draft the scope statement. The deliverables, exclusions, and limits of the project will all be outlined in this document.</li>
  <li><b>Scope baseline:</b>Incorporating the scope statement and the user stories into a project management plan will provide the scope baseline. It will be continually revised as the project develops to account for new requirements.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Scope Documentation:</b> The scope of the E-Cliniq will be documented in the following ways:<p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Requirements documentation:</b>A requirements specification document will be created to record the system's needs.</li>
  <li><b>Project management plan:</b> Everything that needs to be known about the project's scope will be included in the project management plan, from the scope statement to the scope baseline and beyond.</li>
</ol> 

<p><b>Scope Control:</b> A requirements specification document will be created to record the system's needs.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Scope verification:</b> The project team will employ agile testing methods to ensure the project's final products are up to par with the project's stated goals and objectives.</li>
  <li><b>Scope change control:</b> A thorough change control process will be implemented to oversee any alterations to the project's scope, and its effects on time, money, and quality will be evaluated.</li>
  <li><b>Scope change review:</b> Every requested shift from the project's original scope will be subject to a review to determine whether or not it is essential, achievable, and in line with the project's goals.</li>
</ol>

==Scope Management Approach==
<ol>
  <li>John Angel Manahan, the project manager, will be given the authority and responsibility for scope management. He will collaborate closely with Jojo Castillo, the project sponsor, and other important stakeholders to define and manage the project's scope.</li>
  <li>A detailed Statement of Work (SOW), Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and Scope Statement will be created to describe the project's scope. Before work starts, the project sponsor and other stakeholders will review and approve these documents, which will clearly explain the project deliverables, tasks, and requirements.</li>
  <li>The project's scope will be assessed and confirmed using quality checklists, measures of worker performance, and routine comparisons of project development with the baseline scope. The scope change process will be used to identify and remedy any deviations from the scope baseline.</li>
  <li>For the E-Cliniq project, the scope change procedure entails the Project Manager submitting a scope change request, with the project sponsor giving final approval. Any alterations to the project's scope must be thoroughly assessed to make sure they are in line with its objectives and aims and won't have a detrimental effect on the project's budget or timeline.</li>
  <li>The project sponsor and other important stakeholders will accept and approve the final deliverables, and the project manager oversees making sure that all project requirements have been satisfied. Once all deliverables have been accepted and any outstanding problems have been fixed, the project will be declared to have been successfully completed.</li>
</ol>

==Roles and Responsibilities==
<p>The following roles and responsibilities have been assigned in relation to scope management:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Project Manager:</b> The scope of the project must be established and documented, and any changes to the scope must be controlled and approved by the project manager.</li>
  <li><b>Product owner:</b> The product owner oversees illustrating the stakeholders' demands and objectives and making sure the project adds value to the company.</li>
<li><b>Project Team:</b> The project team oversees confirming the project's scope and, if necessary, submitting change requests.</li>
  <li><b>Stakeholders:</b> Stakeholders are in charge of offering feedback on the project's requirements and scope and of authorizing changes to that scope as necessary.</li>
</ol>

==Scope Definition==
<p>The scope of this project includes the development of a single system that combines the functionality of patient record management, appointment scheduling, and inventory management to be used by the APC Clinic. This system will include features such operating hour that can prevent any appointments from being set during non-operating hours, notification system for appointment cancellations, and reporting feature for appointment and inventory.
<br><br>
The system will also include an improved record management process to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Clinic.
</p>

==Project Scope Statement==
<p>The E-Cliniq project's deliverables and the labor required to produce them are described in the project scope statement.</p>

<p><b>Product Scope Description:</b></p>
<p>The E-Cliniq system will be a web-based tool that allows clinic nurse to manage patient records, appointments, and inventory. It also allows users to see their personal records in the clinic, schedule their own appointments, and receive notifications regarding their appointment. This system will include features such as digitized patient records, setting operating hours, and report generation.</p>

<p><b>Product Acceptance Criteria:</b></p>
<p>The E-Cliniq will be considered complete and accepted by the customer when it meets the following criteria:</p>

==Scope Control==
<p>Scope control is an essential part of project management that involves monitoring and controlling the project's scope to ensure that it remains within the defined parameters. To effectively control the project's scope, it is crucial to have a change control process that outlines the procedures for making changes to the scope baseline. The following is a comprehensive scope control plan that details the change process for making changes to the scope baseline for the E-Cliniq project:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Scope Change Request:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The first step in the change process is to identify the need for a scope change and document it in a scope change request.</li>
        <li>The scope change request should include a detailed description of the change, its impact on the project, and the reason for the change.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>Scope Change Evaluation:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Once a scope change request has been submitted, the project team should evaluate the change request to determine its impact on the project.</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

=Cost Management Plan=

==Introduction==
<p>As healthcare continues to evolve, the implementation of the E-Cliniq system has become essential for Asia Pacific College’s clinic. E-Cliniq is a system where a digital version of a patient's medical record can be accessed and updated in real-time by authorized personnel of the clinic. The use of the E-Cliniq system in a school clinic can significantly improve the quality of health care provided to students and school staff, medicine inventory management, setting and managing appointments. <br><br>
This cost management plan will outline the various costs associated with implementing the E-Cliniq system to the school clinic, including hardware and software expenses, training and support costs, and ongoing maintenance and upgrades. By following this cost management plan, the school clinic can successfully implement the E-Cliniq system and provide high-quality healthcare services to their students.</p>

<p>
<b>Cost management responsibilities:</b>
<ul>
  <li>The Project Sponsor will be responsible for cost management of the project and will be the primary point of contact for all cost-related issues.</li>
  <li>The Project Manager will be responsible for monitoring project costs and ensuring that they are within the approved budget.</li>
</ul>

<b>Cost change Approval:</b>
<ul><li>All cost changes must be approved by the Project Sponsor before they are implemented.</li></ul>

<b>Budget format and standards:</b>
<ul>
<li>The budget will be presented in a clear concise format using an Excel spreadsheet.</li>
<li>The budget will be broken down into individual line items with detailed cost estimates for each item.</li>
</ul>

</p>

==Cost Management Approach==
<p>The cost management approach for the E-Cliniq will be based on the following principles:
</p>
<br>
<p>
a.	Clear definition of costs:
-	The project team will work closely with the stakeholders to carefully take notes of the project's costs, including hardware, labor, and hosting expenses..
<br>
<br>
b.	Cost estimates:
-	The project developers will use cost estimation techniques to ensure the project budget is accurate and realistic using bottom-up estimation.
<br>
<br>
c.	Cost management roles and responsibilities:
-	Clear roles and responsibilities for cost management will be defined and communicated to all project team members.
<br>
<br>
d.	Approval process for changes:
-	A formal process for approving changes in the project or the budget for the project will be established and implemented. Details are discussed in the Cost Change Control Process section.
<br>
<br>
e.	Reporting and communication:
-	Regular cost reports will be prepared and shared with stakeholders including the project sponsor, team, and management. Details are discussed in the Reporting Format section.
</p>

<p>By practicing these principles and practices, the project team will be able to effectively manage costs and ensure that the project stays on budget.</p>

==Measuring Project Costs==
<p>The Cost Management Plan for the E-Cliniq System project will include a detailed approach for measuring project costs using Earned Value Management (EVM) (citation needed). This will involve capturing and reporting on various Earned Value metrics, such as:
</p>
<p>
1. Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) – This will measure the budgeted costs of the work that was planned to be completed at a specific point in time.
</p>

<p>
Example:<br>

To calculate the BCWS or Planned Value, we need to multiply the total labor cost of the TESTING WBS by its percentage of completion:

BCWS = Total labor cost of TESTING WBS x Percentage of completion

= (PHP 300,000) x 33.71%

= PHP 101,130

Therefore, the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) for the TESTING WBS is PHP 101,130.
</p>

<p>
2. Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) - This will measure the budgeted costs of the work that has been completed at a specific point in time.
</p>

<p>
Example:<br>
To calculate the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV), we need to know the percentage of work completed for each task or WBS element.  
<br><br>
Assuming that the percentage of completion for each of the Testing Phase tasks are as follows:
<br>

<ul>
<li>Week 26: Testing Phase 1 - 100%</li>
<li>Week 27: Testing Phase 2 - 75%</li>
<li>Week 28: Testing Phase 3 - 50%</li>
<li>Week 29: Testing Phase 4 - 25%</li>
</ul>
<p>
Then, we can calculate the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) as follows:<br><br>
EV = BCWS x % of work completed<br>
EV = (₱300,000 x 33.71%) + (₱75,000 x 8.43% x 0.75) + (₱75,000 x 8.43% x 0.50) + (₱75,000 x 8.43% x 0.25)<br>
EV = ₱101,130 + ₱4,732.50 + ₱3,155 + ₱1,577.50<br>
EV = ₱110,595<br><br>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) is ₱110,595.
</p>

<p>
3. Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) - This will measure the actual costs incurred for the work that has been completed at a specific point in time.
<br>
Example:<br>
Assuming that the Actual Cost for the TESTING WBS is PHP 120,000, then:<br>

AC = PHP 120,000<br><br>

Therefore, the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) is PHP 120,000.<br><br>

These metrics will be used to perform cost variance analysis (CV), schedule performance index (SPI), and cost performance index (CPI) to measure the project's cost performance over time.
To assist in capturing these metrics, the project team will use project management software that is capable of tracking and reporting on EVM metrics. This software will also be used to 
forecast future project costs, and to review cost performance over time, across work packages or schedule activities.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Cost Variance (CV) measures the difference between the actual cost and the planned cost of the project. It is calculated by subtracting the actual cost from the planned cost. A negative CV indicates that the project is over budget, while a positive CV indicates that the project is under budget.<br>

Example:<br><br>

To compute the Cost Variance (CV), we need to subtract the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) from the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV). From the previous example, the BCWP or EV is ₱110,595, and the ACWP or AC is ₱120,000.<br><br>

CV = EV - AC<br>
CV = ₱110,595 - ₱120,000<br>
CV = -₱9,405<br><br>

Therefore, the Cost Variance (CV) for the Testing WBS is -₱9,405. A negative CV means that the project is over budget.<br>
</li>
<li>
Schedule Performance Index (SPI) measures the project's schedule performance by comparing the planned schedule to the actual schedule. This index is calculated as the ratio of the BCWP to the BCWS. It is calculated by dividing the earned value by the planned value. A value of 1 indicates that the project is on schedule, while a value less than 1 indicates that the project is behind schedule, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the project is ahead of schedule.<br><br>

Example:<br>

From the previous computations, we have:<br>

Earned Value (EV) = ₱110,595<br>
Planned Value (PV) = ₱101,130<br>
Plugging these values into the formula, we get:<br><br>

SPI = EV / PV<br>
SPI = ₱110,595 / ₱101,130<br>
SPI = 1.093<br><br>

Therefore, the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is 1.093. This indicates that the project is ahead of schedule, as the SPI is greater than 1.<br>
</li>
<li>
Cost Performance Index (CPI) measures the project's cost performance by comparing the actual cost to the planned cost. This index is calculated as the ratio of the BCWP to the ACWP. It is calculated by dividing the earned value by the actual cost. A value of 1 indicates that the project is on budget, while a value less than 1 indicates that the project is over budget, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the project is under budget.<br><br>

Example:<br>
To calculate the Cost Performance Index (CPI), we need to use the following formula:<br>

CPI = EV / AC<br>
where:<br>
EV = Earned Value (BCWP) <br>
AC = Actual Cost (ACWP)<br>

From the previous computations, we have:<br>
EV = ₱110,595<br>
AC = ₱120,000<br><br>

CPI = EV / AC<br>
CPI = ₱110,595 / ₱120,000<br>
CPI = 0.9216<br><br>

Therefore, the Cost Performance Index (CPI) is 0.9216. This means that for every one peso spent, the project has earned only 0.92 pesos of value. This indicates that the project is behind budget and may need to take corrective actions to bring the costs in line with the planned budget.<br><br>

In summary, the Cost Management Plan will ensure that the project costs are effectively managed and controlled throughout the project’s lifecycle by using Earned Value Management metrics, schedule performance index, and cost performance index. These metrics will help the team to identify the areas where the project is underperforming and take corrective actions to bring the project back on track.<br>
</li>
</ol>

==Reporting Format==
<p>
The ideal reporting format for the cost management plan of the Dispatch Directory system project would likely be a detailed spreadsheet or table. This format should include all relevant cost information such as project budget, actual costs incurred, projected costs, and any variances or discrepancies.<br><br>
In addition, the format should be easily understandable and accessible to all stakeholders, including the project team, stakeholders, and management. A bar chart can also be included to provide visual representation of costs.<br><br>
The reporting format for the cost management plan of the Dispatch Directory system project would include the following elements:<br>
</p>

<p>
1.Executive Summary:<br>
A brief overview of the cost management plan including the project’s overall budget and major cost variances or issues.br>

2.Budget Overview:<br>
A detailed breakdown of the budget for the project that includes the total project cost and cost of other resources (e.g., Labor, Hosting, Equipment, etc.).<br>

3.Cost Variance Analysis:<br>
A detailed analysis of any variances between the project’s actual costs and the budgeted costs. This should include a detailed explanation of the causes of the variances, the impact on the project and any action taken to address them.

4.Budget Forecast:<br>
A projection of the project’s future costs, including any potential cost variances and their potential impact on the project. <br>

5.Approval and Sign-off:<br>
A section for the project manager and other key stakeholders to review, approve and sign off on the cost management plan.<br>

6.Appendices:<br>
Any additional documentation or supporting materials such as detailed cost and breakdowns, invoices or change requests.<br><br>

</p>

==Cost Variance Response Process==
<p>
The Cost Variance Response process for the E-Cliniq system will be as follows:<br>

1.Control Thresholds:<br>
-	The project will have control thresholds set for cost variance.<br>
-	These thresholds will be set at 10% and 20% of the total project budget.<br>
-	If the project triggers any of these thresholds, it will be considered a cost variance.<br><br>

2.	Identification of Variance:<br>
-	The project Manager will be responsible for identifying any cost variances and reporting them to the Project Sponsor.<br><br>

3.	Analysis of Variance:<br>
-	The Project Manager will analyze the variance to determine the root cause of the problem and develop options for corrective action.<br>
-	The Project Manager will also consider the impact of the variance on the project schedule and scope.<br><br>

4.	Presentation of Options:<br>
-	The Project Manager will present the options for corrective action to the Project Sponsor.<br>
--	The options will be based on the root cause of the variance and impact on the project schedule and scope.<br><br>

5.	Approval of Corrective Action:<br>
-	The Project Sponsor will review the options and approve an appropriate action to bring the project back on budget.<br>
-	This may include increasing the budget, reducing the scope or quality or implementing other corrective actions.<br><br>

6.	Implementation of Corrective Action:<br>
-	The Project Manager will implement the approved corrective action and monitor the results.<br>
-	The Project Manager will also update the project schedule and budget accordingly.<br><br>

7.	Reporting:<br>
-	The Project Manager will report on the cost variance, corrective action taken and the results of the corrective action in the Monthly Project Status Report.<br>
-	The Project Manager will also provide updates on the project budget and schedule.<br><br>

The Cost Variance Response process will be an ongoing process throughout the project lifecycle. The project Manager will be responsible for monitoring and controlling the project costs, and the Project Sponsor will be responsible for approving any corrective actions needed.<br>
</p>

==Cost Change Control Process==
<p>
The cost change control process will include the following steps:<br><br>

1.	Identification of the cost change:<br>
-	Any proposed changes to the project budget or costs must be identified and documented on a cost change request form.<br><br>
2.	Analysis of the cost change:<br>
-	The proposed change will be analyzed by the project team to determine the potential impact on the project schedule, resources, and overall budget.<br><br>
3.	Approval of the cost change:<br>
-	The cost change request will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor and other relevant stakeholders.<br><br>
4.	Implementation of the cost change:<br>
-	Once approved, the cost change will be implemented in accordance. The cost change control process will follow the established project change request process.  Approvals for project budget/cost changes must be approved by the project sponsor.<br><br>
5.	Tracking and monitoring of the cost change:<br>
-	The project team will track and monitor the cost change's impact on the project schedule and budget, and any necessary adjustments to ensure it is still on track.<br><br>
6.	Reporting on the cost change:<br>
-	The cost change will be reported in the monthly status report along with any relevant financial information and any corrective actions.<br><br>

The cost change control process will be implemented to ensure that any changes to the project budget are identified, analyzed, and lastly, approved promptly. This will help minimize the impact of cost changes and maximize productivity and will make sure that the project is still on track.<br>

=Scope Change=

==Introduction==
<p>The schedule management plan is made to ensure that all project activities are completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of stakeholders. An effective implementation of this schedule management plan is essential for this project's success, as it allows teams to prioritize tasks, allocate resources, and track progress towards project goals.
<br><br>
This plan outlines the approach and methods that the team utilized to manage the project schedule and provides a general overview of the key elements that should be included in the plan, such as the project schedule, milestones, dependencies, and resource requirements.
<br><br>
The plan also identifies the roles and responsibilities of the project team members responsible for implementing and maintaining the schedule management plan. By outlining these key elements, the schedule management plan helps to ensure that everyone involved in the project is on the same page and working towards the same objectives.
<br><br>
In the following sections, we will provide more detailed information on each of these key elements and explain how they will be integrated into the overall project management process. By following this plan, we can ensure that our project is completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.
</p>

==Schedule Management Approach==
<p>The project team will use ProjectLibre as our scheduling tool, as it is a user-friendly open-source project management tool that the team is familiar with. The software will be used to create a detailed project schedule that outlines all project activities, milestones, and deadlines. The schedule will be updated regularly to ensure that all team members are aware of their assigned tasks and deadlines. Using ProjectLibre will help us to effectively manage the project schedule and ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget.</p>

<p>After careful consideration and evaluation, our team created an initial draft of the schedule milestones and estimated the duration of each milestone throughout the project. The following milestones have been identified:</p>

<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">

<h2>Schedule Control</h2>
<p>For the project's duration, the schedule will be updated regularly to ensure it remains current and reflects any changes to the project plan. After careful consideration, the team has decided to give daily updates to each other regarding the assigned tasks to each member. They have also made schedule reviews with the project adviser that will be conducted at regular intervals on Monday 12:45pm to 1:30pm to assess progress and identify any potential issues that may impact on the project timeline.</p>

<p>The project team has also concluded to meet with the stakeholders weekly. The project manager will be responsible for providing regular updates to stakeholders, including the project team, project sponsor, and other key stakeholders. The team will also send daily progress reports to ensure that stakeholders are informed of project status.</p>

<p>If there are any updates or problems the team might encounter, the project manager will be responsible for overall schedule management, including the development, maintenance, and updating of the project schedule. The project team will be responsible for providing input on schedule development and for ensuring that project tasks are completed according to the schedule. The project sponsor will be responsible for providing guidance and support to the project manager as needed, and for ensuring that the project is aligned with organizational objectives.</p>

==Schedule Changes and Thresholds==
<p>To ensure the project stays on track, it is important to set boundaries on the project schedule. Any schedule changes that exceed these boundaries require a schedule change request, which must be approved by the project sponsor before being implemented.</p>

<p>For this project if any of the following apply, a schedule change request must be submitted to the project stakeholder for approval, if not, then submission is made for approval to the project manager:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The suggested change is to limit the length of deliverables of a given Sprint Backlog during the project's development phase, to make it obvious that adding something to the duration does not indicate extending the work across the full duration.  </li>
	<li>Changes to the scope statement must be taken into consideration to prevent conflicts during the project's documentation phase. The project team must compile every mistake in the document before expanding the work packages by 5% or more to reflect the changes in all the documentation.</li>
	<li>A different way to implement the changes is to either cut or extend the project's overall timetable by 10% or more. </li>
</ul>

==Scope Change==
<p>If a problem arises that requires a substantial change in the project scope, it is best to propose a scope change. Note that the project manager and team must assess the status of the project schedule and determine how the scope change will impact the schedule and its resources moving forward. Any project team member or project client may ask to change the project's scope. All change requests must be submitted in a project change request document to the project advisor. Following that, the project manager will go over the requested change to the project's scope. After deep consideration of the project team and it is important to advise with the project adviser that will either reject the request for change if it does not fit in with the project's goals or schedule a meeting with the project client and project team to discuss further. Following initial approval from the project client and project adviser, the project manager will communicate the scope change to the project sponsor and all relevant stakeholders before any implementation occurs.</p>

=Staffing Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>A key factor in E-Cliniq's success is the human resource plan. The project calls for a well-organized and qualified team to complete it because it is a full clinic management system designed to efficiently manage patient data, appointments, and inventory. The Human Resource Plan's goal is to describe the approaches and steps required to recruit and oversee the project team members throughout the project lifecycle.</p>

<p>To guarantee that the correct people with the relevant experience and abilities are assigned to the right responsibilities within the project, effective human resource management is essential. The Human Resource Plan aims to increase productivity, improve collaboration, and reduce the risks related to understaffing or skill gaps by carefully identifying and assigning resources.</p>

==Roles and Responsibilities==
<p>E-Cliniq's project organizational chart gives a visual depiction of the project team and the connections among the important stakeholders. The project manager, who oversees overseeing the project's resources, scope, and schedule, is often listed above the project sponsor in the organizational chart. To contribute to the system's needs and take part in user testing, an internal user of the system, such as the APC Nurse, Doctor, and Dentist, are added. To get input on the system's usability and functionality, external users (APC Patients) may also be incorporated. Each stakeholder's roles and responsibilities are made clear by the organizational chart, ensuring that everyone is on the same page with the project's goals and objectives.</p>

==Staffing Management==
<p>A crucial element in guaranteeing the project's effective execution is the staffing management plan for E-Cliniq. Throughout the project lifetime, it describes the tactics and procedures for recruiting, supervising, and releasing human resources.</p>
<ul>
       <li>Acquisition of human resources will be done in a timely manner to ensure that the necessary skills and expertise are in place when needed. This may include recruiting new hires, hiring contractors, or utilizing internal staff. The timeline for resource acquisition will be aligned with the project schedule to ensure that resources are available when needed.</li>
       <li>Training for any resources with identified gaps in skills required will be provided to ensure that they have the necessary knowledge and capabilities to perform their roles effectively. This may include both on-the-job training and formal training programs.</li>
       <li>Performance reviews will be conducted regularly to assess the performance of team members and identify areas for improvement. These reviews will also provide feedback on how well team members are meeting the project's expectations and objectives.</li>
       <li>A rewards and recognition system will be implemented to acknowledge and motivate outstanding performance. This may include bonuses, promotions, and other incentives.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is significant to note that other factors, such as organizational health and safety, government and/or regulatory compliance, and others, may be included in staffing management depending on the project's scope. It relies on the industry's particular rules and regulations, as well as the setting where E-Cliniq is being used. If the project is bound by rules and regulations relating to data protection and security, government and regulatory compliance may be considered. If the project calls for the use of tools or technologies that could put team members at risk, organizational health and safety may also need to be considered.</p>
<p>To keep it in line with the goals and needs of the project, the Staffing Management Plan will be periodically reviewed and revised as required. The project manager must carefully examine the rules and specifications that apply to the project in question to ascertain whether any other elements need to be included in the workforce management strategy.</p>

=Communications Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Communications Management Plan is a critical component of the E-Cliniq project as it outlines the communication strategy and protocols for the project team and stakeholders. The plan defines the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The plan details the information to be communicated, such as project updates, progress reports, risks, and issues, including the level of detail and format.</li>
    <li>The plan specifies the communication methods to be used, such as meetings, email, telephone, web portal, etc., to ensure timely information for all stakeholders.</li>
    <li>The plan sets the frequency of project communications, both formal and informal, to keep stakeholders regularly informed.</li>
    <li>The plan defines the roles and responsibilities of team members and stakeholders in communication, including who disseminates project information.</li>
    <li>The plan addresses the specific communication needs of all stakeholders, such as language requirements and accessibility.</li>
    <li>The plan allocates resources for communication, such as budget and personnel, to ensure effective and efficient communication.</li>
    <li>The plan sets protocols for communicating sensitive or confidential information, including authorization for release.</li>
    <li>The plan establishes a process for managing changes in communication or the communication process, including proposal, review, and approval of changes to ensure consistency throughout the project.</li>
    <li>The plan outlines the flow of communication within the project, including information sharing between team members, stakeholders, and other project partners to ensure timely information for all stakeholders.</li>
    <li>The plan identifies any internal or external constraints that may affect project communications and outlines how these constraints will be addressed.</li>
    <li>The plan specifies any standard templates, formats, or documents to be used for communicating project information to provide consistent and accurate information to all stakeholders.</li>
    <li>The plan includes an escalation process for resolving any communication-based conflicts or issues that may arise during the project to ensure timely resolution of communication-related issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the Communications Management Plan is a key tool that helps to ensure that all stakeholders are informed, and that communication is effective and efficient throughout the E-Cliniq project.</p>

==Communications Management Approach==
<p>The most effective approach to managing communications for the E-Cliniq project would involve combining proactive and reactive strategies.</p>

<p>Proactively, regular project status meetings will be conducted to keep all stakeholders well-informed and updated on the project's progress. The project manager will regularly meet with the project team, providing updates, progress reports, and addressing any risks or issues. This approach will offer stakeholders a comprehensive overview of the project's status and potential obstacles. Additionally, a dedicated project website and web portal will be established, granting stakeholders convenient access to project-related information such as meeting minutes, documents, and status reports.</p>

<p>Reactively, an escalation process will be established to promptly address any conflicts or issues related to communication. The project manager will be readily available to respond to stakeholders' questions or concerns, offering support and guidance when necessary.</p>

<p>Moreover, a change control process will be implemented to manage any alterations in communication or the communication process. This process will involve obtaining approval from the Change Control Board and ensuring stakeholders are promptly informed of any changes. Overall, this approach guarantees that the project team and stakeholders remain well-informed, while effectively handling any communication-related challenges that may arise.</p>

==Communications Management Constraints==
<p>The Communications Management Constraints for the E-Cliniq project are an important part of the overall project management plan. These constraints define limitations and boundaries that may affect the project’s communication processes and strategies. By identifying and addressing these constraints, the project team can proactively develop solutions to mitigate potential challenges and ensure smooth information flow.</p>

<p>This section of the Communications Management Plan provides an overview of key constraints that may impact the project’s communication processes, including internal and external factors, technological limitations, and regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>Communications management constraints for the E-Cliniq project may include:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Limited budget for communication tools and resources such as video conferencing software, project management software, or hiring a dedicated communications team may be a constraint.</li>
   <li>Limited access to certain stakeholders located in remote locations or with limited access to certain forms of communication may be a constraint.</li>
   <li>Limited availability of team members due to other commitments or responsibilities may be a constraint.</li>
   <li>Language barriers may require translation services or additional resources to facilitate communication.</li>
   <li>Confidentiality of some project information may require special handling and communication protocols.</li>
   <li>Resistance to changes in communication processes or tools by some stakeholders can make it difficult to implement new communication strategies.</li>
   <li>Technical difficulties with communication tools and systems can be a constraint.</li>
   <li>Time constraints due to tight project deadlines can make it challenging to schedule and hold regular communication meetings.</li>

</ol>

==Stakeholder Communication Requirements==
<p>This section of the Communications Management Plan outlines the specific communication needs of stakeholders and how they will be met throughout the project's life cycle.</p>

<p>The Stakeholder Communication Requirements are a crucial part of the E-Cliniq project as they detail the specific communication needs of all stakeholders. Effective communication is essential for completing the project on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders. By identifying and addressing stakeholders' communication requirements, the project team can proactively manage expectations, build trust, and foster collaboration.</p>

<p>This section of the Communications Management Plan outlines stakeholders' specific communication needs and how they will be met throughout the project's lifecycle.</p>

<p>The E-Cliniq project would probably require stakeholder communication needs such as:</p>
<ol>
    <li><p><b>Regular project updates: </b>It is imperative to consistently inform all stakeholders about the project's progress, including the disclosure of any emerging issues or risks.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Clear and concise communication: </b>Project-related information needs to be conveyed in a manner that is easily understood and succinct, ensuring stakeholders comprehend the message effectively.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Accessibility:</b>Communication should be accessible to all stakeholders, considering any language or accessibility requirements they may have.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Timely communication: </b>Information should be communicated promptly, guaranteeing that stakeholders receive it in a timely manner, without delays.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Confidentiality:</b>Sensitive or confidential information must only be shared with relevant stakeholders and handled securely to maintain confidentiality.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Customized communication: </b> Communication should be tailored to meet the specific needs of each stakeholder, considering their level of involvement in the project and their respective roles.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Two-way communication: </b>Effective communication involves active participation from both parties, allowing stakeholders to provide feedback and seek clarification through meaningful dialogue.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Feedback mechanisms: </b>Mechanisms should be in place to facilitate stakeholder feedback on the communication process, ensuring continuous improvement and effectiveness.</p></li>
</ol>

This includes determining the appropriate methods for delivering project updates, progress reports, risks, issues, and other relevant information.</p>

<p>It’s important to consider the cost and feasibility of using different technologies, as well as any security or privacy concerns. By carefully selecting the most appropriate communication methods and technologies, the project team can ensure that all stakeholders are kept informed and that the project’s communication objectives are met.</p>

<p>When determining the best communication methods and technologies for E-Cliniq, several factors should be considered. These include:</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>The scope and complexity of the project: </b>Web portals and project management software are frequently the best option when dealing with large-scale and complex projects since they make it easier to gather information and give all stakeholders easy access.</li>
   <li><b>The technical proficiency of the stakeholders: </b>For stakeholders without technical proficiency, direct communication techniques like email and phone may be the best option.</li>
   <li><b>The type of information being communicated:</b>Using secure techniques like encryption and password-protected portals may be necessary when dealing with sensitive or confidential material.</li>
   <li><b>The project's budget and resources: </b>Communication strategies and technology should be chosen in accordance with the project's allotted budget and resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the factors mentioned earlier, it is recommended that the E-Cliniq project use a combination of communication methods and technologies such as project management software, email, telephone, and video conferencing to keep all stakeholders informed and meet the project's communication objectives.</p>

   <li><b>Scheduling:</b>It is important to plan meetings in advance and at times that are convenient for all participants. Meeting invitations and scheduling are the project manager's responsibilities.</li>
   <li><b>Attendance:</b>Unless they have a legitimate excuse, all project team members and stakeholders are required to attend meetings. Team members should let the project manager know as soon as possible if they won't be able to attend.</li>
   <li><b>Agenda:</b>Prior to the meeting, an agenda specifying the subjects to be covered and the desired results should be distributed. Doing agendas will make sure that everyone is ready and that the meeting is kept to schedule.</li>
   <li><b>Minutes:</b>Minutes of the meeting should be recorded and given to all participants within 24 hours. A summary of the conversations, the conclusions made, and the assigned action items should all be included in the minutes.</li>
   <li><b>Decisions:</b> Whenever achievable, decisions should be reached by consensus. If agreement cannot be obtained, the project sponsor will have final say.</li>
   <li><b>Follow-up:</b>The project manager oversees making sure that action items are followed up on and finished on schedule.</li>
   <li><b>Communication:</b>Project updates and problems are discussed during meetings. Participants should be urged to speak honestly and openly.</li>
   <li><b>Technology:</b>Accessible technology should be used during meetings for all participants. This could involve web conferences, video conferences, or teleconferences.</li>
   <li><b>Time management:</b>Meetings must begin and end on schedule, and they must not last longer than arranged. This will make sure that attendees aren't kept waiting, and the project will finish on time.</li>
   <li><b>Evaluation:</b>To ensure that meetings are successful and that participants are happy with the results, they should be frequently evaluated. Any problems must be resolved, and improvements made.</li>
</ul>
==Communication Standards==
<p>The best communication standards for the E-Cliniq project may include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>File Naming Convention: </b>Creating a standardized file naming convention for files and documents shared on the project will help assure simple information access and organization. </li>
    <li><b>Web portal/Network Tool: </b>By using a common platform, such as SharePoint or project management software, for project communication, team members and stakeholders can collaborate more effectively and have easier access to information.</li>
    <li><b>Video conferencing: </b>Team members and stakeholders that are spread out geographically can benefit greatly from using video conferencing platforms like Google Meets, Zoom, Skype, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Communication protocols: </b>Sensitive data can be protected by having a standard communication protocol in place that specifies who is authorized to share it and how it should be shared.</li>
</ul>

==Communication Escalation Process==
<p>The ideal and best communication escalation process for the E-Cliniq project would involve the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Identify the issue:</b>The first step for the project team in escalating a communication-related issue is to identify the issue that needs to be escalated.</li>
    <li><b>Attempt to resolve the issue within the team: </b>The project team should first try to resolve the communication-related issue within the team by discussing it with relevant team members and finding a solution.</li>
    <li><b>Involve a communication manager: </b>If the communication-related issue cannot be resolved within the team, the team should involve a communication manager or a designated person responsible for communication within the organization. This person will act as a liaison between the project team and stakeholders to help resolve the issue.</li>
    <li><b>Escalate to higher management: </b>If the communication-related issue still cannot be resolved, it should be escalated to higher management for further review and resolution.</li>
    <li><b>Document the issue and resolution: </b> During the escalation process, it’s important to document the issue, the steps taken to resolve it, and the final resolution to keep proper records for future reference.</li>
    <li><b>Review and Improve:</b> After the escalation process, it’s important to review the process to identify areas for improvement for future escalations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The escalation process should be flexible and adaptable to the specific needs of the project. The project team should regularly review the escalation process to ensure it remains effective and efficient in addressing communication-related issues.</p>

On a common platform, all quality control measurements will be collected and tracked in real-time. The team will collaborate to address any problems and implement any necessary improvements.</p>


=Risk Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The E-Cliniq system aims to provide an Electronic Health Record and Appointment system for the Asia Pacific College’s Clinic.
<br><br>
The development team's duties and responsibilities, the risk assessments plan, and an overview of the risk management process are all included in the risk management plan. The plan will also describe the risk monitoring and management procedures and risk response tactics. The plan's effectiveness will be judged by how quickly threats are identified and dealt with.
<br><br>
The following are information that are considered when developing a Risk Management Plan for the project, E-Cliniq:
<br><br>
•Identifying Risk: The E-Cliniq system development, implementation, and operation project group ought to be aware of any potential dangers. Risks may appear from several unusual places, including technical problems, legal requirements, cybersecurity, and human factors. Risks should be identified and then evaluated for both chance of occurrence and potential effects on the project.
<br><br>
•Risk Monitoring: Risk management is an ongoing activity that needs regular observation and evaluation. To guarantee that risk management procedures are still effective, risks are updated, and new risks are discovered, the project team should establish a frequent review process. All stakeholders should be informed of any changes during the review process, which should be open and transparent.
<br><br>
•Contingency Plans: The project team needs to create backup plans for major risks that could have a significant impact on the project's success. Plans for alternatives ought to specify the actions needed to lessen the risk's effects and keep the project moving forward. As the project develops and new risks are discovered, these strategies should be periodically reviewed and modified. 
<br><br>
•Risk Mitigation Tactics: The project team should create a plan for minimizing or avoiding the risks after having identified and assessed the risks. Prioritizing mitigation tactics should be done in accordance with how well they reduce risk and how easily they can be implemented in terms of both time and money. Contingency planning, redundancy, risk transfer through insurance, and the creation of fallback processes strategies.
<br><br>

The E-Cliniq System development team will ensure that the project is executed effectively, satisfying all objectives while avoiding potential risks by taking these extra considerations into account in a risk management plan.
</p>

==Top Three Risks==
<ol>
    <li>The E-Cliniq system would not synchronize the information of the patients being recorded if the internet connection is disrupted and/or lost during the process.</li>
    <li>The information cannot be transferred/exchanged safely if the internet connection is lost and if there was a problem/issue that unexpectedly occurs with the router that connects the devices together.</li>
    <li>The data in the E-Cliniq system can be vulnerable with risks when it comes to new employees being hired since the core data, which is the patient’s recorded data, can be interacted by the employees.</li>
</ol>

==Risk Management Approach==
<p>The steps below are to help in being able to manage risks in the E-Cliniq system:
<br><br>
•Risk Identification and Assessment: The risks will be listed in a risk register together with details about their likelihood of happening, potential effects, and description. The identified risks will be assessed in terms of their likelihood of occurring and their effect on the project. The project team will rank each risk according to severity using the risk matrix. Risks with an elevated level of severity will be prioritized for either mitigation or contingency planning.
<br><br>
•Risk Monitoring: Risks will be continuously monitored during the project. To ensure that risks are being effectively managed, the project team will frequently review the risk register. As further threats are found and added to the risk register throughout the project, the risk assessment process will be repeated.
<br><br>
•Risk Mitigation: Plans for risk mitigation will be developed for risks having a high effect and likelihood of occurrence. The risk-mitigation strategies will be included in the mitigation plans. The project team will also decide on fallback plans for risks that cannot be minimized.
<br><br>
•Risk Communication: Risk communication is the process of alerting relevant parties—including the project sponsor, the project team, and other stakeholders—about risks and related management strategies. If any risks are identified, assessed, and dealt with, the project team will keep all stakeholders informed and maintain regular communication.
</p>

==Risk Identification==
<p>During risk assessment meetings, the development team and relevant stakeholders were asked to identify and evaluate risks to the project's success. The dangers that were found were listed in a risk registry.
<br><br>
The risks discovered during the risk assessment meeting were documented in a manner consistent with the Agile risk management plan. To guarantee that new risks are found, and old risks are efficiently managed, the risk register is updated on a regular basis. The development team will keep an eye on and manage risks all the way through the project. The following are the project's potential risks for the E-Cliniq system:
<br><br>
•Human Error: Errors made by relevant stakeholders, having the potential of having an influence on the system.<br><br>
•Security Vulnerabilities: The initiative runs the risk of being exposed to security lapses or data loss, both of which might have dire repercussions.<br><br>
•Unforeseen Circumstances: There is a chance that unanticipated events (such as connection loss) could have an unexpected effect on the system.<br><br>

</p>

==Risk Qualification and Prioritization==
<p>The development team will regularly review and update the risk record to make sure that risks are prioritized appropriately. The risks mentioned in the risk records were classified and evaluated using a probability-impact matrix. Risks that would have a significant effect on the project and a high possibility of occurring were given top consideration. Determining the probability and impact of each risk after analyzing potential risks related to the E-Cliniq system. Following is an overview of the likelihood of risks and their effects on the project:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Extreme: Risks that could seriously harm the system and have an extremely high possibility of happening.</li>

==Risk Monitoring==
<p>
The E-Cliniq Risk Management Plan offers a framework for actively tracking risks throughout the project. To do this, it is crucial to closely document the process, including defining the circumstances that might set off risks, and to regularly monitor risks during the system lifecycle.
<br><br>
The high-scoring risks will be incorporated into the project schedule, and the risk manager will be given responsibility for their monitoring. This will make it easier for the project manager to decide when hazards need to be closely monitored and when the risk manager should provide project team meetings with updates. The risk manager will oversee monitoring the risk trigger circumstances. The project manager will also make sure that the project team is informed of the risks that have been identified and their potential effects on the project. Any new risks or modifications to existing risks should be reported to the risk management by the project team so that they can be evaluated and given the appropriate level of priority.
<br><br>
The agile risk management methodology, which emphasizes flexibility and constant improvement, will be used by the development team. To guarantee that the system’s goals and quality standards are met, the effectiveness of the risk management plan will be periodically evaluated and changed, as necessary.
</p>

==Risk Mitigation and Avoidance==
<p>The project team will develop the risk management plan based on the value that each risk is given. The first stage in risk mitigation and avoidance is to identify and prioritize the potential risks. Strategies to prepare for likely delays could include preparing backup plans, allocating more resources, or changing project deadlines. The project team should determine which risks have the highest likelihood and potential impact and then establish plans to reduce or eliminate those risks. The project manager has the following main factors and choices to think about:
<br><br>
•Resource Allocation: The project manager must make sure the team has the necessary resources, including competence, abilities, and expertise, as well as access to tools and equipment, for the system to be effective and efficient. The project manager oversees the system, making sure that the team has access to these resources to complete the system on schedule and within the allocated budget.
<br><br>
•Risk Assessment: To effectively estimate and manage potential hazards, the development team should do a detailed analysis of them. Early in the project, the risk assessment should be finished, and the project manager should move quickly to identify and reduce any potential risks. 
<br><br>
•Contingency Planning: The project team must develop backup plans for emergencies to be ready for potential dangers. The project manager is responsible for supervising the creation, validation, and testing of these strategies for each potential risk.
<br><br>
•Agile Approach: Risk management can be done in a flexible and quick manner by using the Agile methodology. The team's use of the Agile methodology, which permits continual risk management and the capacity for change, must be ensured by the project manager.
<br><br>
•Communication: The project manager must encourage open and transparent communication between the development team and relevant stakeholders to reduce risks and avoid misunderstandings.
</p>

==Risk Register==
<p>Each risk, its likelihood, potential repercussions, and any mitigation steps will be fully explained in the risk register, which will be maintained throughout the project. The risk register will be reviewed and updated frequently to make sure it accurately reflects the state of the project at the present time. The risk registry, which will be stored in a central location, will be accessible to all relevant stakeholders.
<br><br>
This risk management strategy is often in line with the Agile methodology and places an emphasis on early and frequent risk discovery, collaborative risk management, and continuing risk monitoring. By foreseeing and resolving potential risks, the E-Cliniq system development team can decrease the effects and increase the likelihood that the project will succeed. The risk register will be based on the following standards:
<br><br>
•	Risk ID - Each risk will receive a special identification number.
<br><br>
•	Risk Description - The risk event will be clearly and concisely described.
<br><br>
•	Risk Category - Risks will be categorized as technical, organizational, or legal.
<br><br>
•	Risk Owner - Will oversee keeping an eye on and managing every risk.
<br><br>
•	Probability - On a scale of 1 to 5, with one denoting the lowest chance and five denoting the highest, the likelihood of a risk occurring is evaluated.
<br><br>
•	Impact - On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents the least significant impact and five represents the most significant impact, the risk's potential impact on the project is evaluated.
<br><br>
•	Risk Score - To calculate the overall risk score, the likelihood and impact scores are compounded.
<br><br>
•	Mitigation Strategy - explains the precise steps that must be taken to reduce the risk.
<br><br> 
•	Status - The current state of the risk, including whether it is open, ongoing, or closed, is also recorded.
<br><br>
•	Target Resolution Date - predicted day that the risk will be resolved.
<br><br>

==Workforce Transition==
<p>A crucial component of the E-Cliniq project's transition out plan is staff transformation. Determining and sharing the workforce plan of time is crucial for a seamless and effective transition. To decide the best course of action for the workforce, the Transition Project Manager will collaborate closely with the customer, the existing and new contractors, and the transition team.
<br><br>
This can entail keeping on with the existing workforce, transferring them to the new contractor, or hiring whole new personnel. The workforce must be notified of any changes in a timely and polite manner; therefore, communication will be crucial in this process.
<br><br>
To ensure that all personnel are aware of their options and are given the appropriate support throughout the transition process, the Transition Project Manager will closely collaborate with HR and management. The employees will also get the necessary training or retraining to ensure that they are fully prepared to continue offering high-quality services both during and after the transition phase. To guarantee that the project is successfully finished on time and within budget, the workforce transition strategy will be constantly evaluated and amended as required.
</p>

==Workforce Execution During Transition==
<p>During the transition period of the E-Cliniq project, work will still need to be performed they are as follows: <br><br>
•User Training: This will entail creating and distributing training materials to inform users of the new system. The training sessions will probably last three days and include both classroom and hands-on instruction.<br>
•Go Live: This will be the new system's official launch. Before releasing the system to users, the team must make sure that all systems are set up and operating properly. Final system testing and confirming that all data has migrated properly will probably be required for this.<br>
•Document Lessons Learned: The lessons learned throughout the project will be documented during this phase. This includes determining the team's strengths and weaknesses as well as the areas for growth. The document will be used to ensure that best practices are adopted moving forward and to provide guidance for future initiatives.<br>
•Update Files/Records: The team will oversee updating all pertinent files and records to indicate the project's completion during this phase. This can entail keeping old copies of specific papers or adding new information to contracts and agreements.<br>
•Gain Formal Acceptance: Obtaining the customer's formal approval that the transition has been successfully completed is part of this phase. The team will have to guarantee that all deliverables have been made and that the client is happy with the new system.<br>
•Archive Files/Documents: Archiving all project-related files and papers is part of this phase. Contracts, agreements, project plans, and other pertinent documents may be included.<br>
•Project Close Out Meeting: A project close out meeting with all stakeholders will take place during the transition's final stage. This will be a chance to talk about the project, as well as any accomplishments or areas that could be used better, and to make sure that any lingering problems have been fixed.<br>
</p>

==Subcontracts==
<p>There are presently no contracts or subcontract agreements relating to this project, hence no transfer, transition, or related agreements are required.</p>

==Property Transition==
===Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)===
<p>This element of the transition plan is not applicable because Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) is not involved in the E-Cliniq project.</p>
===Incumbent Owned Equipment===
<p>The equipment that the incumbent owns and will keep is something that needs to be made very clear. The strategy should include whether the new contractor or customer will have the choice to purchase or utilize any equipment required to support the client's applications and services. The strategy should also outline a timetable for ownership transfer as well as any supporting paperwork, including purchase agreements or bills of sale.
<br><br>
If APC can offer the appropriate equipment upon transition in the instance of the E-Cliniq project, the project team might not be required to transfer the equipment to the APC Medical Clinic. To facilitate a smooth transition and prevent any potential conflicts or misunderstandings, it is still crucial to explicitly define which equipment is owned by the incumbent and which will be supplied by APC. To make sure that all necessary equipment is available and appropriately transported, the project team should closely collaborate with APC and APC Clinic.
</p>

===Intellectual Property===
<p>To ensure a smooth transfer of all pertinent data, supplier and subcontractor information, service agreements, original drawings, or plans, it is crucial to take IP (Intellectual Property) handling into account during the transition phase of the E-Cliniq project. Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) between the incumbent and the client are one of the many legal issues that arise from IP.
<br><br>
The following steps will be taken to ensure proper handling of intellectual property during the transition:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Identification of all relevant intellectual property:</b>The project's entire intellectual property portfolio, including but not limited to design documents, patents, trademarks, copyrights, software code, and any proprietary data or trade secrets, will be identified.</li>
    <li><b>Evaluation of contractual agreements:</b>To ensure compliance during the transition, the current contractual agreements regarding intellectual property ownership and transfer will be reviewed and evaluated.</li>
    <li><b>Negotiation of new agreements:</b>To ensure the right ownership and transfer of any intellectual property, new agreements will be written between the incumbent, new contractor, and customer if there are any conflicts or shortcomings in the existing ones.</li>
    <li><b>Protection of intellectual property:</b>Adequate safeguards, including nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) and other legal procedures, shall be put in place to guarantee the preservation of any intellectual property during the transition time.</li>
    <li><b>Transfer of intellectual property:</b>All relevant intellectual property will be transferred once the transition process is complete in accordance with the current contract arrangements. Depending on the conditions outlined in the agreements, the intellectual property will either be transferred to the new contractor, the client, or retained by the incumbent.</li>
</ol>

<p>By following these steps, E-Cliniq can ensure a smooth and secure transition of all intellectual property related to the project.</p>

===User Accounts and Passwords===
<p>As part of the transition plan for the E-Cliniq project, it is important to address the transition of user accounts and passwords. The following details the steps and considerations for this aspect of the property transition:</p>
<ol>
   <li><b>User Account Inventory</b>•	It is crucial to compile an exhaustive inventory of all user accounts and their associated privileges. System administrators, outside vendors, and end users should all be included in this inventory of internal and external users. The inventory should also make it abundantly clear which accounts are inactive or no longer necessary for the system.</li>
   <li><b>Password Security</b>•	Security must be maintained during the transfer, and this can be done by resetting or deactivating all user passwords. This action will stop unauthorized users from accessing the system and its data. Users should be told to change their passwords to a temporary one issued to them before the changeover takes place. As a result, all users should be required to create new, secure passwords throughout the transition by the new contractor or system owner.</li>
   <li><b>Account Transition and Disablement</b>•	The next duty is to decide which accounts will go through the transition process and which accounts will be terminated after taking care of the inventory and password security measures. To ensure a smooth transition, the transition strategy should specify in detail who is responsible for managing the transfer of accounts and passwords.
•	If it becomes necessary to disable accounts, the transition plan should provide detailed instructions on how to do so. This is essential to guarantee that access privileges for fired workers, independent contractors, or third-party vendors are swiftly canceled.
</li>
   <li><b>Table of User Accounts</b>A table listing all user accounts that will either go through the transition or be disabled must be included in the transition plan. This table needs to list each account's username, associated email address, and applicable access rights. The table should also state if the account will be transitioned or disabled, along with any transition instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that transferring user accounts and passwords is a crucial part of E-Cliniq’s transitioning its property. A seamless and safe transfer can be achieved by following account transition and disablement processes, adhering to a complete inventory, implementing password security measures, providing a user account table, and following the account transition and disablement procedures.</p>

==Knowledge Transfer==
<p>Documentation/Manuals: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The APC Medical Clinic will receive instructions and documentation from the project team and senior developer.</li>
    <li>A project overview, system architecture, functional requirements, technical specifications, and other pertinent information will be included in the documentation to aid clinic employees in understanding the system and how it functions.</li>
    <li>Step-by-step instructions on how to carry out system-related tasks are provided in the manuals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Training: </p>
<ul>
    <li>To guarantee that they completely comprehend the system and its procedures, the APC Medical Clinic personnel will receive individualized training from the project team and senior developer.</li>
    <li>The personnel at the APC Medical Clinic will also have access to online training materials and tools that can assist them advance their system-related knowledge and abilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make sure that the knowledge transfer is successful and that any concerns or problems are dealt with as soon as possible, regular check-ins and meetings will be organized between the project team, senior developer, and APC Clinic as part of the Knowledge Transfer Plan. To make sure the clinic staff has access to the most recent information, any modifications or changes to the system will be documented and communicated to them.</p>
