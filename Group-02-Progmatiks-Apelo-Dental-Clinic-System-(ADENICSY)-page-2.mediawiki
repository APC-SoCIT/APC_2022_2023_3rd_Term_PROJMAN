==Glossary of Terms==
<p><strong>Scrum</strong> – is a process encourages practitioners to work with what they have and continually evaluate what is working and what is not working. Communication, which is an important part of the process, is carried out through meetings, called Events. Sprint Planning Meeting - a sprint refers to the time frame in which work must be completed, and it's often 30 days. Everyone participates in setting the goals, and at the end, at least one increment -- a usable piece of software -- should be produced.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint Review</strong> - this is the time to show off the increment. Sprint Retrospective - is a meeting that's held after a Sprint ends. During this meeting, everyone reflects on the Sprint process. A team-building exercise may also be offered. An important goal of a Sprint Retrospective is continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint backlog</strong> - is a list of tasks that must be completed before selected product backlog items can be delivered. These are divided in to time-based user stories.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud integration</strong> - is the process of configuring multiple application programs to share data in the cloud. In a network that incorporates cloud integration, diverse applications communicate either directly or through third-party software.</p>
<p><strong>Risk management</strong> - is the process of identifying, assessing and controlling threats to an organization's capital and earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Project Charter</strong> - is a formal, typically short document that describes your project in its entirety including what the objectives are, how it will be carried out, and who the stakeholders are.</p>
