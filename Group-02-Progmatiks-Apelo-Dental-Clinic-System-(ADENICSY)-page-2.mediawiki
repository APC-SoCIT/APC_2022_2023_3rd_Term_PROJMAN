<ol>
<li>User Account Inventory  
Firstly, it is essential to create a detailed inventory that encompasses all user accounts and their corresponding privileges. This inventory should encompass both internal and external users, including system administrators, third-party vendors, and end users. Additionally, the inventory should clearly indicate which accounts are inactive or no longer required for the system.</li>
<li>Password Security 
Maintaining security during the transition is crucial, and this can be achieved by resetting or disabling all user passwords. By taking this step, unauthorized access to the system and its data can be prevented. Before the transition takes place, users should be informed to change their passwords to a temporary one provided to them. Subsequently, during the transition, the new contractor or system owner should enforce the creation of new, strong passwords by all users.</li>
<li>Account Transition and Disablement 
After addressing the inventory and password security measures, the subsequent task is to determine which accounts will undergo the transition process and which accounts will be deactivated. The transition plan should clearly outline the individuals entrusted with overseeing the transfer of accounts and passwords, ensuring a seamless transition. 

If there is a need to disable accounts, the transition plan should provide comprehensive information regarding the process and procedures for deactivating accounts. This is crucial to ensure that the access rights of terminated employees, contractors, or third-party vendors are promptly revoked.</li>

<li>Table of User Accounts 

Within the transition plan, it is necessary to include a table comprising all user accounts that will either undergo the transition or be disabled. This table should encompass the username, associated email address, and corresponding privileges or access rights for each account. Additionally, the table should specify whether the account will be transitioned or disabled, accompanied by any specific instructions for the transition process.</li>

<p>To conclude, the transfer of user accounts and passwords is a critical component of the Apelo Dental Clinic project's property transition plan. By adhering to a thorough inventory, implementing password security measures, following account transition and disablement procedures, and furnishing a user account table, a seamless and secure transition can be accomplished.</p>

=Work Breakdown Structure=

==Introduction==
<p>The Apelo Dental Clinic System has the main goal to lessen the waiting time of the patients through queueing management, digitalization of patient’s dental records, and automating several manual processes to improve the clinic’s performance. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for Apelo Dental Clinic System outlines the various work packages that must be accomplished to deliver a functional and user-friendly e-commerce web application. The WBS presents the project scope and helps in defining the deliverables that must be accomplished to meet the project objectives. This document will provide an overview of the WBS layout for Apelo Dental Clinic System.</p>
<br>
<p>The WBS is organized into five major phases, which include project planning, analysis and design, development, documentation, and development II. Each phase is further broken down into several sub-phases or work packages, which are numbered for easy reference. The WBS has been designed to accommodate the key stakeholders, including the project owner, Doctor Denroe Apelo. Doctor Apelo will have the opportunity to review the WBS to ensure that the project goals are being met, and any adjustments can be made before the project progresses too far.</p>
<br>
<p>Overall, the WBS for Apelo Dental Clinic System provides a comprehensive view of the tasks needed to deliver a fully-functional e-commerce web application. It is an essential tool that helps the project team in tracking and monitoring the progress of the project, ensuring that it is delivered on time and to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.</p>
<br>

==Outline View==
<p>The outline view for the work breakdown structure (WBS) of Apelo Dental Clinic System provides a straightforward and clear layout that is easy to understand. This layout is particularly useful during the development phase of the project as it enables the project team to make changes quickly and efficiently. The outline view displays the hierarchical structure of the WBS, which allows the project team to easily see the various levels of the project and how they relate to one another. With this view, the team can easily identify the major deliverables of the project and the sub-deliverables that contribute to the completion of each major deliverable. This helps ensure that the project team stays on track and is able to complete the project within the established timeline.</p>

==Glossary of Terms==
<p><strong>Scrum</strong> – is a process encourages practitioners to work with what they have and continually evaluate what is working and what is not working. Communication, which is an important part of the process, is carried out through meetings, called Events. Sprint Planning Meeting - a sprint refers to the time frame in which work must be completed, and it's often 30 days. Everyone participates in setting the goals, and at the end, at least one increment -- a usable piece of software -- should be produced.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint Review</strong> - this is the time to show off the increment. Sprint Retrospective - is a meeting that's held after a Sprint ends. During this meeting, everyone reflects on the Sprint process. A team-building exercise may also be offered. An important goal of a Sprint Retrospective is continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint backlog</strong> - is a list of tasks that must be completed before selected product backlog items can be delivered. These are divided in to time-based user stories.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud integration</strong> - is the process of configuring multiple application programs to share data in the cloud. In a network that incorporates cloud integration, diverse applications communicate either directly or through third-party software.</p>
<p><strong>Risk management</strong> - is the process of identifying, assessing and controlling threats to an organization's capital and earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Project Charter</strong> - is a formal, typically short document that describes your project in its entirety including what the objectives are, how it will be carried out, and who the stakeholders are.</p>
<p>Level of Effort:       Level of Effort (LOE) is how much work is required to complete a task.</p>
<p>WBS Code:              A unique identifier assigned to each element in a Work Breakdown Structure for designating the elements hierarchical location within the WBS.</p>
<p>Work Package:         A Work Package is a deliverable or work component at the lowest level of its WBS branch.</p>
<p>WBS Component:    A component of a WBS which is located at any level.  It can be a Work Package or a WBS Element as there's no restriction on what a WBS Component is.</p>
<p>WBS Element:         A WBS Element is a single WBS component and its associated attributes located anywhere within a WBS.  A WBS Element can contain work, or it can contain other WBS Elements or Work Packages.</p>
