=Staffing Management Plan=

==Introduction==
<p>
A project system requires a group of people to provide the deliverables and goals of the project. Good human resource management in a team will make the process of building a system efficient and effective, this will be the plan and the path followed by the team members, where the project and its assigned member are to be managed and structured. Plan provides the requirements and qualifications for a member that fits the task or deliverable. Determining the roles, responsibilities, duties, performances, capabilities, skills, experience, and knowledge are all part of a strategy that could be managed and strategized the staffing management well.
</p>

<p>
Using the plan will benefit the project leader or manager and the project team as they can effectively and efficiently manage the deliverables for the project. It informs the members about their assigned tasks and deliverables that lets them understand the qualifications, the needs of the deliverable, and the importance of communication within the team is needed aside from just being assigned to specific tasks. The purpose of this strategized plan is to monitor and manage the assigned contributions of members which will lead to the system's success.
</p>

==Roles and Responsibilities==

<p>
A way of having effective staffing management in the team is very crucial to put into place because it determines the outcome of the system. A concise discussion and planning for the system are needed to ensure the deliverables and tasks that will be distributed. Roles and Responsibilities indicate not only the staff within the team but also the people who are related to this project, its clients, and targets. The roles and responsibilities ensure to let everyone is aware of their contributions to the project.
</p>

<p>
The Roles and Responsibilities indicate the privileges of having the authority and decision for each member ensuring the resources and opportunities provided are effective. To come up with this, first, is to clearly define the capabilities and requirements for the given deliverables that will be assigned to rightful members that will contribute to achieving the system’s success.

==Project Organizational Chart==

<p>
The Project Organizational Chart of the RAM-IT: ITRO’s Chatbot and Ticketing System provides a visual representation of the team and its clients and customers. The project sponsor of the system is the one above all of the members of the project, and the project sponsor provides ideas, changes, and suggestions for what is better for their office and the system itself. Next is the adviser who oversees the system's build and structure and the documentation needed to complete the project.
</p>

<p>
The organizational chart includes the sponsor and adviser as the higher-ups of the project team, next are the members who are in the project team, which are the project manager who leads and seeks feedback from the higher-ups and next is the member who do tasks, and the major deliverables to build the system.

==Staffing Management Plan==

<p>
Staffing Management is an important component for the RAM-IT to have where the cause lies here the success of the system built for the client. It mainly focuses on the strategy used to develop each of the deliverables to build the system. Other than the development also lies the managing and releasing or calling-out of personnel as the project development process. 
</p>

<p>
As for the RAM-IT's purpose and scope, it is needed to have management within the members of the team as if a situation comes that one or two of the major developers are not available for a time, there are few of the members left to handle or to do the task for a while. To further comply with the situations given, proper management is needed. The team expected that anytime there will be changes in the member's deliverables and tasks as the process goes on.
</p>

<p>
It should be regular for the team to check and review the member assigned and it's working deliverable and remains the scope and purpose of the project aligns with the project's goal. The project manager needs to call and advise the members about their roles and responsibilities and their sub-category roles for emergencies, to properly manage the staffing within the team.

=Change Management Plan=

==Introduction==

<p> A Change Management plan is needed in many projects and is the crucial part of 
developing a project system and writing documentation for it, including the RAM-IT: Chatbot 
and Ticketing System. Every change should be processed orderly by reviewing, presenting, and 
deciding before implementing it. The plan outlines a structure that approaches the updating, 
identifying, and implementing changes that may happen to the future course of the developing 
project system. This plan ensures that the updates, changes, or modifications to the project 
system are thoroughly planned and evaluated by the project team and the client or the 
stakeholder.</P>

<p>The plan is a method for giving suggestions and recommendations for the project system through the processing of listing the features until the point that the process of approved by the stakeholder. This process is encouraged to do between the project team and the stakeholder, there will be discussions that may come up that the plan for the change by the project team will not always be approved, and the stakeholder will provide feedback or an idea that came from the project team's change plan or an on-point idea from the stakeholder. Though the project team considers their authority in developing the project system, still the modifications for the project system are needed to be approved by the stakeholders by executing it in an orderly. The rejected changes or modifications for the project system still be noted and documented for future development or updates that may or can be added from the project system upon presentation and approval of the stakeholder.</P>

<p>It is required to be aware of the changes and modifications that will be added or updated 
to the project system, a project team may see these modifications as a good sight or an 
opportunity for the betterment of the project. Though there will still experience a negative impact 
on the project system's progress, this is why it is critical for the project team and even for the 
stakeholders to blatantly decide to proceed or just approve a change for the project system and 
thus shows that the change management plan is also considered a critical plan and needs to have 
better planning and execution. The change management plan will assist and guarantees that the 
changes and deadlines for the modifications will contribute to the project's success.</P>

By considering these additional factors in a risk management plan, the ITRO Ticketing System project team can ensure that the project is completed successfully, meeting all objectives while minimizing potential risks.

== Top Three Risks ==

The project's top three risks are:

* '''High Ticket Volume and Workload''': One of the key risks in customer support for the ITRO Ticketing System is the potential for a high volume of incoming tickets, which can overwhelm the support team and lead to delays in response and resolution times. This risk may arise due to system issues, user inquiries, or service disruptions.

* '''Inadequate Customer Support Resources''': Insufficient staffing or a lack of trained personnel in customer support can lead to subpar service quality and dissatisfaction among users. This risk may result in delayed ticket resolution, decreased customer satisfaction, and negative impacts on the project reputation.

* '''System Downtime and Technical Issues''': The ITRO Ticketing System may experience unexpected downtime or technical issues, leading to service disruptions and delays in customer support. This risk could be caused by hardware failures, software bugs, network outages, or insufficient system capacity.

== Risk Management Approach ==

The risk management approach for ITRO Ticketing System customer support involves a proactive and systematic process to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks associated with providing efficient and effective customer support.

The following steps will be taken to manage risks in the ITRO Ticketing System project:

* '''Risk Identification''': Thoroughly analyze the customer support process to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities. This involves considering factors such as ticket volume, system issues, skill gaps, and customer escalations.

* '''Risk Assessment''': Evaluate the identified risks based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. Prioritize risks that have a higher probability of occurring and can cause significant disruptions or customer dissatisfaction.

* '''Risk Mitigation''': Develop and implement strategies to minimize the identified risks. This may involve various measures such as effective ticket prioritization, training and development programs for support staff, automation of routine tasks, and clear escalation procedures.

* '''Risk Monitoring''': Continuously monitor and review the effectiveness of the implemented risk mitigation measures. Regularly track support metrics, customer feedback, and emerging trends to identify new risks or changes in existing risks.

* '''Risk Response''': If a risk materializes or the actual measurements do not meet the established standards or requirements, take appropriate actions to address the situation promptly. This may involve reassessing mitigation strategies, reallocating resources, or implementing corrective measures.

* '''Communication and Documentation''': Maintain clear communication channels to report and document risk-related information. This includes documenting risk assessments, mitigation plans, actions taken, and outcomes. Regularly share risk updates and findings in project status meetings or as necessary throughout the project lifecycle.

== Risk Identification ==

By reviewing the common risks that involve a ticketing system, the project team has identified potential risks that may occur during the project’s life cycle. By identifying the risks connected to ITRO Ticketing System, the project team has documented a risk register that includes a brief description, potential impact, and likelihood of occurrence for potential hazards.

Throughout the project development and documentation meetings, the project team and key stakeholders were able to discuss the potential risks that can affect the success of the project. During this meeting, the project team gained an understanding of what are the risks involved when developing and planning for such a complex system during and after project development.

Some of the potential risks identified for the ITRO Ticketing System project include:

* '''Scope creep''': There is a risk that the scope of the project may expand beyond its original boundaries, leading to delays and cost overruns.

* '''Technical Challenges''': Complex technical system that requires expertise, innovative problem-solving, and effective decision-making.

* '''Security Risks''': There is a risk to social engineering and cyberattacks compromising sensitive information.

* '''Dependencies on external parties''': The project may be dependent on the cooperation and performance of external parties, which could lead to delays or other issues.

* '''Lack of resources''': There is a risk that the project may not have access to sufficient resources (e.g., personnel, budget, equipment) to complete the project as planned.

* '''Unforeseen circumstances''': There is a risk that unforeseen circumstances (e.g., natural disasters) could impact the project in unexpected ways.

To effectively address these risks, the project team has implemented multiple strategies. These include rigorous testing and validation processes, leveraging an Agile development methodology for swift identification and resolution of technical issues, offering comprehensive training and support to team members for seamless system adoption, and maintaining consistent communication with key stakeholders to promptly identify and mitigate potential delays or challenges.

== Risk Qualification and Prioritization ==
The risks identified for the ITRO Ticketing Systems customer support will be thoroughly assessed and categorized based on their potential impact and probability of occurrence. This will enable the project team to prioritize and allocate resources effectively, focusing on high-impact risks with a higher likelihood of occurrence.

A probability-impact matrix was used to qualify and rank the dangers listed in the risk registry. High priority was given to risks that had a high likelihood of happening and a major impact on the project. To ensure that risks are given the proper priority, the project team will review and update the risk register on a regular basis. This will ensure that proactive mitigation measures are implemented to minimize the impact of identified risks on the project's success.

We have used a probability-impact matrix to qualify and prioritize the risks for this project. We have categorized the risks into four categories: Extreme, High, Medium, Low, and Negligible.

The probability of risks happening and their impact on the project is described below:

* '''Extreme''': Risks with a very high probability of occurring and a severe impact on the project.
* '''High''': Risks with a high probability of occurring and a significant impact on the project. These risks require immediate attention, and we need to develop mitigation strategies for them.
* '''Medium''': Risks with a medium probability of occurring and a moderate impact on the project. These risks should be closely monitored, and mitigation strategies should be developed in case they occur.
* '''Low''': Risks with a low probability of occurring and a minor impact on the project. These risks can be monitored periodically, and mitigation strategies can be developed in case they occur.
* '''Negligible''': Risks with a very low probability of occurring and negligible impact on the project. These risks can be ignored.

* '''Lack of Project Management & Planning''' - Medium Probability and High Impact

To maintain alignment with the agile risk management plan, the project team will consistently review and update the risk register throughout the project. This will involve qualifying and prioritizing risks, ensuring their inclusion in sprint planning sessions. By doing so, the team will be well-informed about the potential risks and able to plan accordingly. Furthermore, we will foster an environment that encourages the team to actively identify and promptly report any new risks that may arise during the project's course of action.

== Risk Monitoring ==

The project team will conduct regular risk reviews during sprint retrospectives to assess the status of identified risks. This includes evaluating the impact and likelihood of each risk, as well as identifying any new risks that may have emerged. The reviews will help in identifying trends, evaluating risk mitigation strategies, and determining the effectiveness of risk responses.

The project team will utilize a centralized risk register or tracking tool to document and track risks throughout the project lifecycle. This will enable real-time monitoring of risks, including their status, assigned owners, and mitigation actions. The risk register will be updated regularly to reflect the latest information and progress on risk management activities.

Effective risk monitoring requires transparent communication among team members and stakeholders. Regular project status meetings and other communication channels will be used to discuss and share risk-related information. This will facilitate timely identification and resolution of risks, as well as ensure that all stakeholders are informed about the project's risk profile.

By implementing these risk monitoring practices, the project team will be able to proactively identify, assess, and address risks throughout the agile project lifecycle, thereby minimizing the potential impact on the ITRO Ticketing System.

== Risk Mitigation and Avoidance ==

The project team will collaboratively develop the risk management plan, assigning appropriate importance to each identified risk. Engaging stakeholders, the team will implement mitigation measures and consistently evaluate their effectiveness.

To commence risk mitigation and avoidance, the team will first identify and prioritize potential risks. Emphasis will be placed on risks with significant likelihood and impact, devising strategies to minimize or eliminate them. The project manager will consider the following crucial factors and available options:

* '''Risk Assessment''': It is imperative for the team to conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential risks to proactively anticipate and address them. The project manager should prioritize completing the risk assessment early in the project and take swift actions to identify and mitigate any potential risks that are identified. By conducting a thorough risk assessment, the project team can effectively minimize the impact of risks and ensure smoother project execution.

* '''Contingency Planning''': plays a crucial role in ensuring preparedness for potential risks. The project team, under the supervision of the project manager, should develop and test backup plans to address contingencies associated with identified risks. These plans should be carefully designed, thoroughly tested, and confirmed to ensure their effectiveness. By proactively establishing contingency measures, the project team can mitigate the impact of risks and maintain project resilience in the face of uncertainties.

* '''Effective Communication''': A crucial aspect of risk management is fostering transparent and effective communication among the project team, clients, and stakeholders. The project manager plays a vital role in promoting clear channels of communication to minimize risks and prevent any potential misunderstandings. Open lines of communication facilitate the timely exchange of information, feedback, and concerns, enabling proactive risk identification and mitigation throughout the project lifecycle.

These are general strategies to mitigate and avoid potential risks throughout the project lifecycle. These steps ensure the management of risks that the project team will discover pre and post-development. Using the agile methodology, the group will be able to manage risks and adapt to changes more dynamically. This approach to mitigation and avoidance will be beneficial to all key stakeholders and to the project team.

== Risk Register ==

The risk register, serving as a comprehensive repository of potential risks, will be diligently maintained and continuously updated throughout the project's duration. It will encompass in-depth descriptions of each risk, encompassing its likelihood and potential impact, accompanied by documented mitigation measures. To ensure its relevance and accuracy, the risk register will undergo regular review and timely updates, aligning with the project's evolving landscape. Embracing a collaborative approach, this risk management strategy fosters early and frequent risk identification, fostering an environment of proactive risk mitigation. In adherence to the Agile methodology, all stakeholders will have convenient access to the centralized risk register, enabling collective awareness and engagement in the risk management process. This will help the project team to track and prioritize risk, assign responsibilities, and track progress in risk mitigation.

The following criteria will be used for the risk register:

*'''Risk ID''': Each risk will be assigned a unique identifier.
*'''Risk Description''': There will be a clear and concise description of the risk event.
*'''Risk Category''': Risks will be classified into technical, organizational, or legal categories.
*'''Risk Owner''': A designated individual or team will be responsible for monitoring and managing each risk.
*'''Probability''': Likelihood of a risk occurring is assessed using a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the lowest likelihood and 5 indicating the highest.
*'''Impact''': The risk's potential impact on the project is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the least significant impact and 5 indicating the most significant impact.
*'''Risk Score''': The probability and impact scores are multiplied to determine the overall risk.
*'''Status''': The risk's status, whether it is open, in progress, or closed, is also documented.

=Procurement Management Plan=

==Introduction==

<p>
The Procurement Management Plan establishes the framework for acquiring goods and services in this project. It will serve as a roadmap for managing procurement throughout the project's lifespan and will be revised when acquisition needs change. This plan outlines and explains the items that will be obtained, the types of contracts that will be utilized, the process for approving contracts, and the criteria for making decisions. It emphasizes the significance of coordinating procurement activities, establishing clear contract deliverables, and utilizing metrics to assess procurement activities. Additionally, the plan includes considerations for managing procurement risks and outlines how costs will be determined, how standard procurement documentation will be employed, and the constraints associated with procurement.
 </p>


==Procurement Management Approach==

<p>The Project Manager will be responsible for supervising and controlling all procurement operations in this project. Collaborating with the project team, they will identify the necessary items to be acquired to ensure the project's successful execution. Once the procurement list is compiled, it will be reviewed by the project team and stakeholders before being submitted to the contracts and purchasing department. The department will assess the procurement items, decide whether it is more beneficial to produce or purchase them, and initiate the process of selecting vendors, making purchases, and finalizing contracts. </p>

==Procurement Definition==

<p>The following procurement items and/or services have been determined to be essential for project completion and success.  The following list of items/services, justification, and timeline are pending PMO review for submission to the contracts and purchasing department: </p>
<table width="100" border="1">
<tr>
<td>Item/Service</td>
<td>Justification</td>
<td>Needed By</td>

<tr>
<td>Extension Cord</td>
<td>Needed for writing the documentations of the project and to develop the project; we do not make this item</td>
<td>March 31, 2023 </td>
</tr>
</table>
==Type of contract to be used==

<p>All items and services to be procured for this project will be solicited under firm-fixed price contracts.  The project team will work with the contracts and purchasing department to define the item types, quantities, services and required delivery dates.  The contracts and purchasing department will then solicit bids from various vendors to procure the items within the required time frame and at a reasonable cost under the firm fixed price contract once the vendor is selected.  This contract will be awarded for one base year and three option years. </p>
<br>
<br>
==Procurement Risks==

<p>All procurement activities carry some potential for risk which must be managed to ensure project success. While all risks will be managed in accordance with the project’s risk management plan, there are specific risks which pertain specifically to procurement which must be considered: </p> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrealistic schedule and cost expectations for vendors <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing capacity capabilities of vendors <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflicts with current contracts and vendor relationships <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Configuration management for upgrades and improvements of purchased technology. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential delays in shipping and impacts on cost and schedule <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Questionable past performance for vendors <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential that final product does not meet required specifications.<br>
<br>
<p>These risks are not all-inclusive and the standard risk management process of identifying, documenting, analyzing, mitigating, and managing risks will be used.  </p>

==Procurement Risk Management==
<p>As mentioned earlier, the project's risk management plan will be used to handle project risks. However, when it comes to procurement-related risks, extra attention and involvement are required. Procurement activities involve external organizations and can have an impact on existing and future business relationships, as well as internal supply chain and vendor management operations. Due to the importance of these relationships and operations, the project team will ensure the participation of both the project sponsor and a designated representative from the contracting department in all project meetings and status reviews. </p> <br>
<br>
<p>Additionally, any decisions regarding procurement actions must be approved by the project client or, in his absence, the Vice President of Contracts before implementation.  Any issues concerning procurement actions, or any newly identified risks will immediately be communicated to the project’s contracting department point of contact as well as the project sponsor.   </p>

==Cost Determination==
<p>To obtain proposals from different vendors detailing how they will fulfill our requirements and the associated costs; we will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for this project. Each proposal must encompass vendor support for items A, B, and C, as outlined in the previous paragraph, along with the base and out-year costs. Vendors will be expected to provide a comprehensive overview of their approach, including the execution of the work, the individuals involved, their relevant experience, customer testimonials, employee backgrounds and resumes, and a detailed breakdown of all costs. Additionally, vendors will be required to submit work breakdown structures (WBSs) and work schedules to demonstrate their understanding of the project's scope and their ability to meet the established timeline. </p> <br>
<br>

<p>It is crucial that all the requested information is included in each proposal, as these proposals will serve as the basis for our selection criteria. Proposals that fail to include the requested information or are incomplete will be disregarded and not considered for further evaluation. </p> <br>
<br>
==Standardized Procurement Documentation==
<p>The procurement management process encompasses various steps and requires ongoing oversight of all procurement activities and contracts. In this dynamic and sensitive environment, our objective is to streamline procurement management through any necessary means to ensure the successful completion of our contracts and projects. To simplify these tasks, we will utilize standardized documentation throughout the procurement management process. These standardized documents have been developed and refined over many years with the aim of continuously enhancing procurement efforts. They offer sufficient levels of detail, enabling easier comparison of proposals, more accurate pricing, more detailed responses, and more effective contract and vendor management. </p> <br>
<br>
<p>The Project Management Office (PMO) maintains a repository on the company's shared drive, which contains standardized project management and procurement documentation specifically designed for this project. The following standardized documents will be utilized for project procurement activities: </p> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard Request for Proposal Template to include <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposal process and timelines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposal guidelines <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposal formats and media <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source selection criteria<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pricing forms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement of work <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terms and Conditions <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal source selection evaluation forms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-disclosure agreement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter of intent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Firm fixed price contract <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Procurement audit form <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Procurement performance evaluation form<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessons learned form<br>
==Procurement Constraints==
<p>The project's procurement management plan encompasses various constraints that must be considered. These constraints will be explicitly stated in the Request for Proposal (RFP) and communicated to all vendors to assess their capability to work within these limitations. The constraints pertain to multiple aspects, including schedule, cost, scope, resources, and technology. </p> <br>
<br>
<p>Schedule: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;The project schedule is inflexible, and all procurement activities, contract administration, and contract fulfillment must be carried out within the predetermined project timeline.<br> </p>

<p>Schedule: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;The project schedule is inflexible, and all procurement activities, contract administration, and contract fulfillment must be carried out within the predetermined project timeline.<br> </p> <br>
<p>Cost: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;The project budget includes contingency and management reserves, but it is important to note that these reserves cannot be utilized for procurement activities. The reserves are specifically designated for approved changes in project scope or at the discretion of the management.<br> </p><br>
<p>Scope: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;Allprocurement activities and contract awards must support the approved project scope statement.  Any procurement activities or contract awards which specify work which is not in direct support of the project’s scope statement will be considered out of scope and disapproved.<br> </p><br>
<p>Resources: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;All procurement activities must be carried out and supervised using existing personnel. There will be no hiring or re-allocation of additional personnel to support the procurement activities for this project.<br> </p><br>
<p>Technology: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •&nbsp;&nbsp;The specifications for parts have already been established and will be outlined in the statement of work within the Request for Proposal (RFP). While proposals may suggest alternative materials or manufacturing processes, the specifications for parts must precisely match those provided in the statement of work.<br> </p><br>
==Contract Approval Process==
<p>The initial phase of the contract approval process involves identifying the items or services that need to be procured from external vendors. This determination is made by conducting a cost analysis, comparing the costs of providing products or services internally versus purchasing them from vendors. Once the cost analyses are completed and the final list of items and services to be procured externally is established, the purchasing and contracts department will proceed to send solicitations to external vendors. </p>
<br>
<p>After the solicitations are completed and proposals are received from all vendors, the approval process commences. The first step is to review all vendor proposals to assess their alignment with the criteria set by the project team and the purchasing and contracts department. Purchases below a certain threshold, such as $x,xxx, only require approval from the Project Manager. On the other hand, purchases exceeding that threshold necessitate approval from the Contract Review Board. The Contract Review Board, comprising representatives from the project team, purchasing and contracts department, finance, and the Project Management Office (PMO), convenes to determine which contract will be accepted for these larger purchases. </p>
==Decision Criteria==
<p>The criteria for the selection and award of procurement contracts under this project will be based on the following decision criteria: </p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ability of the vendor to provide all items by the required delivery date.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected delivery date<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparison of outsourced cost versus in-sourcing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past performance<br>
<p>These criteria will be measured by the contracts review board and/or the Project Manager.  The ultimate decision will be made based on these criteria as well as available resources. </p>
==Vendor Management==
<p>The ultimate responsibility for managing vendors lies with the Project Manager. To ensure the timely delivery and high quality of products from vendors, the Project Manager or their designated representative will conduct weekly meetings with the contract and purchasing department as well as each vendor. These meetings can take place in person or via teleconference. The primary purpose of these meetings is to thoroughly review the documented specifications for each product and examine the findings of quality tests. </p>
<br>
<p>The objective of these meetings is to assess the progress of each procured item, ensuring its compliance with the project specifications. It also provides an opportunity to address any questions or make necessary modifications to contracts or requirements in advance, thus preventing delivery delays and schedule disruptions. The Project Manager will be responsible for scheduling these weekly meetings until all items are delivered and deemed acceptable.</p>
==Performance Metrics for Procurement Activities==
<p>While the purchasing and contracts department has their own internal metrics for procurement, the following metrics are established for vendor performance for this project’s procurement activities.  Each metric is rated on a 1-3 scale as indicated below: </p> <br>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Vendor </td>
<td>Product Quality </td>
<td>On Time Delivery </td>
<td>Documentation Quality </td>
<td>Development Costs </td>
<td>Development Time </td>
<td>Cost per Unit </td>
<td>Transactional Efficiency </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Vendor #1</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p> 1 - Unsatisfactory </p>
<p> 2 - Acceptable </p>
<p> 3 - Exceptional</p>

<p>In addition to rating each vendor, actual values will be noted to build a past-performance database for selecting vendors for future procurement activities. </p>

==1.6.	Subcontracts ==
<p>No contracts or subcontract agreements about this project currently exist, thus there is no need for any transfer or transition of contracts or related agreements.</p>
===1.6.1.	Property Transition ===
<p>#	'''Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)''': Since there is no involvement of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) in RAMIT: Ticketing System, this section of the transition plan is not applicable.
#	'''Incumbent Owned Equipment''': It is crucial to clearly specify the equipment owned by the current party and ensure it remains in their possession. In case there is any equipment required for supporting the customer's applications and services, the plan should indicate whether the new contractor or customer has the choice to buy or utilize it. Additionally, the plan should incorporate a schedule for the transfer of ownership and any essential paperwork, such as bills of sale or agreements for transferring ownership. If ITRO can provide the necessary equipment upon transition, there may not be a need for the project team to transition the equipment to OPTIMUM FIVE. However, it remains crucial to clearly distinguish between the equipment owned by the incumbent and the equipment that will be supplied by ITRO. This is necessary to facilitate a seamless transition and prevent any potential conflicts or misunderstandings. The project team should closely collaborate with ITRO and OPTIMUM FIVE to ensure that all required equipment is accessible and appropriately transferred. 
#	'''Intellectual Property''': During the transition process of RAMIT: Ticketing System, it is crucial to give careful thought to the management of intellectual property (IP) to facilitate a seamless transfer of all pertinent documentation, supplier and subcontractor details, service agreements, as well as original designs or plans. Intellectual property entails various legal considerations and may involve the requirement of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) between the current party and the customer. 
The following steps will be taken to ensure proper handling of intellectual property during the transition:
:##      '''Identification of all relevant intellectual property''': All intellectual property related to the project will be identified, including but not limited to design documents, patents, trademarks, copyrights, software code, and any proprietary information or trade secrets.
:##      '''Evaluation of contractual agreements ''': The current contractual agreements about the ownership and transfer of intellectual property will be examined and assessed to guarantee adherence during the transition.
:##      '''Negotiation of new agreements ''': If there are any discrepancies or inadequacies in the current agreements, new agreements will be negotiated among the incumbent, new contractor, and customer to ensure the appropriate ownership and transfer of all intellectual property.
:##      '''Protection of intellectual property ''': Throughout the transition period, adequate safeguards, such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and other legal measures, will be implemented to ensure the protection of all intellectual property.
:##      '''Transfer of intellectual property ''': Once the transition process is finalized, the transfer of all pertinent intellectual property will be carried out by the contractual agreements in effect. The intellectual property will be transferred to the new contractor, the customer, or retained by the incumbent, depending on the terms specified in the agreements.
#	'''User Accounts and Passwords''': As part of the transition plan for RAMIT: Ticketing System, it is important to address the transition of user accounts and passwords. The following details the steps and considerations for this aspect of the property transition:
  </p>
<p>
:##	'''User Account Inventory'''
*	Firstly, it is essential to create a detailed inventory that encompasses all user accounts and their corresponding privileges. This inventory should encompass both internal and external users, including system administrators, third-party vendors, and end users. Additionally, the inventory should clearly indicate which accounts are inactive or no longer required for the system.
:##	'''Password Security'''
*	Maintaining security during the transition is crucial, and this can be achieved by resetting or disabling all user passwords. By taking this step, unauthorized access to the system and its data can be prevented. Before the transition takes place, users should be informed to change their passwords to a temporary one provided to them. Subsequently, during the transition, the new contractor or system owner should enforce the creation of new, strong passwords by all users.
:##	'''Account Transition and Disablement'''
*	After addressing the inventory and password security measures, the subsequent task is to determine which accounts will undergo the transition process and which accounts will be deactivated. The transition plan should clearly outline the individuals entrusted with overseeing the transfer of accounts and passwords, ensuring a seamless transition.
*	If there is a need to disable accounts, the transition plan should provide comprehensive information regarding the process and procedures for deactivating accounts. This is crucial to ensure that the access rights of terminated employees, contractors, or third-party vendors are promptly revoked.
##	'''Table of User Accounts'''
*	Within the transition plan, it is necessary to include a table comprising all user accounts that will either undergo the transition or be disabled. This table should encompass the username, associated email address, and corresponding privileges or access rights for each account. Additionally, the table should specify whether the account will be transitioned or disabled, accompanied by any specific instructions for the transition process.
</p>
<p>To conclude, the transfer of user accounts and passwords is a critical component of the ITRO project's property transition plan. By adhering to a thorough inventory, implementing password security measures, following account transition and disablement procedures, and furnishing a user account table, a seamless and secure transition can be accomplished.</p>

==1.7.	Knowledge Transfer==
<p>Documentation/Manuals:
*	The project team and senior developer will provide documentation and manuals to the ITRO.
*	The documentation package will encompass an overview of the project, system architecture details, functional requirements, technical specifications, and other pertinent information. This documentation will aid the ITRO staff in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the system and its functionality.
*	The manuals will offer detailed, sequential guidance on executing specific tasks associated with the system.
Training:
*	The project team, along with a senior developer, will provide personalized training to the ITRO to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the system and its operational procedures.
*	The ITRO will be granted access to online training materials and resources, which will assist them in enhancing their knowledge and skills about the system.
*	The ITRO will take on the responsibility of disseminating the information to their staff members, as formal classroom training or scheduled sessions may not be feasible in their dynamic and fast-paced work environment.

As an integral component of the Knowledge Transfer Plan, frequent check-ins and meetings will be arranged between the project team, senior developer, and ITRO. These interactions aim to facilitate a successful transfer of knowledge and address any questions or concerns promptly. Furthermore, any modifications or updates to the system will be documented and shared with the ITRO staff, ensuring that they have access to the latest information.
</p>

==1.9.	Handover and Acceptance==
<p>The process of handover and acceptance will start after the transition plan has been finalized and includes all necessary paperwork and deliverables. To properly evaluate the transition plan and make sure that all required requirements have been completed, the project team will then set up a formal meeting with the project sponsor and other pertinent stakeholders.
The project team will provide the project sponsor and other important stakeholders a presentation of the finished transition plan, including with all the required paperwork and deliverables, at the handover meeting. The project sponsor and stakeholders will next carefully review the documents and have a conversation about any issues or concerns that remain unresolved.
The project sponsor and stakeholders will proceed to sign the official acceptance document once all outstanding issues have been resolved. This document demonstrates that the handover procedure was successfully finished. Along with the signatures of all parties who have examined and approved the contents, the acceptance document will also include a checklist of all required deliverables and paperwork.
The processes for resolving any unresolved problems or concerns that may emerge after the transfer are also outlined in the handover and acceptance section. This can mean adhering to a formal dispute resolution procedure or carrying out corrective measures to address any found flaws.
Overall, the contract transitions out plan's handover and acceptance section will provide a thorough and precise roadmap for carrying out the handover process, ensuring the satisfaction of all stakeholders with the results.
