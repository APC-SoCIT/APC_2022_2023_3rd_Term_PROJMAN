=Staffing Management Plan=

==Introduction==
<p>
A project system requires a group of people to provide the deliverables and goals of the project. Good human resource management in a team will make the process of building a system efficient and effective, this will be the plan and the path followed by the team members, where the project and its assigned member are to be managed and structured. Plan provides the requirements and qualifications for a member that fits the task or deliverable. Determining the roles, responsibilities, duties, performances, capabilities, skills, experience, and knowledge are all part of a strategy that could be managed and strategized the staffing management well.

<p>
A way of having effective staffing management in the team is very crucial to put into place because it determines the outcome of the system. A concise discussion and planning for the system are needed to ensure the deliverables and tasks that will be distributed. Roles and Responsibilities indicate not only the staff within the team but also the people who are related to this project, its clients, and targets. The roles and responsibilities ensure to let everyone is aware of their contributions to the project.
</p>

==Project Organizational Chart==

<p>
The Project Organizational Chart of the RAM-IT: ITRO’s Chatbot and Ticketing System provides a visual representation of the team and its clients and customers. The project sponsor of the system is the one above all of the members of the project, and the project sponsor provides ideas, changes, and suggestions for what is better for their office and the system itself. Next is the adviser who oversees the system's build and structure and the documentation needed to complete the project.
</p>

<p>
The organizational chart includes the sponsor and adviser as the higher-ups of the project team, next are the members who are in the project team, which are the project manager who leads and seeks feedback from the higher-ups and next is the member who do tasks, and the major deliverables to build the system.

==Staffing Management==

<p>
Staffing Management is an important component for the RAM-IT to have where the cause lies here the success of the system built for the client. It mainly focuses on the strategy used to develop each of the deliverables to build the system. Other than the development also lies the managing and releasing or calling-out of personnel as the project development process. 
</p>

<p>
As for the RAM-IT's purpose and scope, it is needed to have management within the members of the team as if a situation comes that one or two of the major developers are not available for a time, there are few of the members left to handle or to do the task for a while. To further comply with the situations given, proper management is needed. The team expected that anytime there will be changes in the member's deliverables and tasks as the process goes on.
</p>

<p>
It should be regular for the team to check and review the member assigned and it's working deliverable and remains the scope and purpose of the project aligns with the project's goal. The project manager needs to call and advise the members about their roles and responsibilities and their sub-category roles for emergencies, to properly manage the staffing within the team.

=Procurement Management Plan=

==Introduction==

<p>
The Procurement Management Plan establishes the framework for acquiring goods and services in this project. It will serve as a roadmap for managing procurement throughout the project's lifespan and will be revised when acquisition needs change. This plan outlines and explains the items that will be obtained, the types of contracts that will be utilized, the process for approving contracts, and the criteria for making decisions. It emphasizes the significance of coordinating procurement activities, establishing clear contract deliverables, and utilizing metrics to assess procurement activities. Additionally, the plan includes considerations for managing procurement risks and outlines how costs will be determined, how standard procurement documentation will be employed, and the constraints associated with procurement.
 </p>


==Procurement Management Approach==

<p>The Project Manager will be responsible for supervising and controlling all procurement operations in this project. Collaborating with the project team, they will identify the necessary items to be acquired to ensure the project's successful execution. Once the procurement list is compiled, it will be reviewed by the project team and stakeholders before being submitted to the contracts and purchasing department. The department will assess the procurement items, decide whether it is more beneficial to produce or purchase them, and initiate the process of selecting vendors, making purchases, and finalizing contracts. </p>

==Procurement Definition==

<p>The following procurement items and/or services have been determined to be essential for project completion and success.  The following list of items/services, justification, and timeline are pending PMO review for submission to the contracts and purchasing department: </p>

==Type of contract to be used==

<p>All items and services to be procured for this project will be solicited under firm-fixed price contracts.  The project team will work with the contracts and purchasing department to define the item types, quantities, services and required delivery dates.  The contracts and purchasing department will then solicit bids from various vendors to procure the items within the required time frame and at a reasonable cost under the firm fixed price contract once the vendor is selected.  This contract will be awarded for one base year and three option years. </p>

==Procurement Risks==

<p>All procurement activities carry some potential for risk which must be managed to ensure project success. While all risks will be managed in accordance with the project’s risk management plan, there are specific risks which pertain specifically to procurement which must be considered: </p>
