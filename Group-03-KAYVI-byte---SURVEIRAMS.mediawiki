==4.3. Problem Definition==

===4.3.1 Problem Statement===

The process of handwritten reports can be tedious and time-consuming, leading to inefficiency and errors in the documentation process. This can result in a lack of clarity and accessibility to vital information for stakeholders such as managers and other employees who require accurate data in a timely manner. The current system also has unnecessary steps that could be eliminated when digitized such as rewriting the information from the logbook onto an incident report to be submitted to the Information Technology Resource Office (ITRO) or Building Maintenance Office (BMO). 

===4.3.2 Organizational Impact===

SurveiRams facilitate the digitization of work processes by reducing the use of paper among employees. Security personnel quickly report incidents they encounter, which allows for a faster response time and enhances overall safety measures within the organization. BMO and ITRO faculty members will also receive the incident reports as soon as a guard logs it, instead of waiting for the rewritten version.

===4.3.3 Technology Migration===

To address the issues brought on by the manual administration of security personnel, BMO, and ITRO, the team will develop a mobile application called SurveiRams that automates the manual documentation procedure. The migration from manual administration to SurveiRams will improve the overall efficiency and accuracy of the security personnel reporting process. As the data will be securely stored and easily accessible to the cloud, it will enable faster decision-making and reduce the risk of errors or discrepancies in reporting.

'''Figure 1. SurveiRams Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)'''

Figure 1 illustrates the SurveiRams WBS in a hierarchical structure. A more detailed discussion for this can be found in the Work Breakdown Structure document. 

==7.2.7 Scope Verification==

The project team will use various techniques for scope verification to guarantee that the SurveiRams System project deliverables satisfy the original scope. These methods include:

*'''Quality Checklists'''

The project team will use checklists that outline the essential requirements for each deliverable to be accepted. These checklists will be employed to ensure that each deliverable satisfies all necessary criteria before progressing.

*'''Work Performance Measurements'''

The team will use work performance measurements to monitor and gauge the advancement of each deliverable during the development phase. This approach will enable the team to detect any issues or deviations from the original scope and take prompt corrective measures.
 
*'''Scope Baseline'''

The team will establish a scope baseline, which captures a snapshot of the initial project scope. Any modifications to the scope must be recorded and authorized before being implemented. The scope baseline will be employed to ensure that the final deliverables align with the original project scope.

*'''Formal Acceptance'''

Each deliverable will be formally accepted by the project sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders upon completion. This ensures that the project team meets the expectations of all relevant parties and allows any necessary feedback or changes to be made promptly.
 
Overall, it is critical that the project team maintains open communication and cooperation with the client and other stakeholders throughout the project to ensure that the deliverables meet the original scope and are formally approved.

==7.2.8 Scope Control==
The change management plan must be consulted if the project scope is changed. The procedures written there will be followed. The change’s impact on the schedule and budget will be factored into making the decision. Should any changes happen, all project documents related will be updated.

=7.3 COST MANAGEMENT PLAN=
The purpose of the Cost Management Plan for the SurveiRams System project is to ensure that all project-related expenses are managed efficiently throughout its entire duration. The plan outlines the techniques and guidelines that will be employed to gauge, communicate, and regulate project expenses.

'''Cost management responsibilities:'''
The Project Manager will be responsible for managing the project's expenses and act as the contact for any cost-related concerns. The Project Leader, on the other hand, will be responsible for supervising project spendings and making sure that it stays within the authorized budget.

'''Cost change approval:'''
Authorization from the Project Manager is required prior to implementing any changes in cost. In case the cost modification exceeds 10% of the total project budget, approval from the Project Sponsor must be obtained before executing it.

'''Cost measurement and reporting:'''
The project expenses will be evaluated and recorded monthly, using the cost performance index (CPI) and the schedule performance index (SPI). Monthly expense reports will be submitted to the Project Sponsor.

'''Budget format and standards:'''
The budget will be presented in a simplified and concise format by utilizing a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel. The budget will be divided into distinct line items, with each item having a detailed cost estimate. It will be updated once there are any changes, and any changes made will be indicated. 
   
Overall, the objective of the Cost Management Plan for the SurveiRams System project is to ensure that all project-related expenses are effectively monitored and controlled, allowing the project to be completed within the assigned budget. This approach will ensure the project's successful and timely completion.


==7.3.1 Cost Management Approach==
The cost management approach for SurveiRams will be based on the following principles:

# '''Clear definition of cost'''  <br> - The project team will define all the costs associated with SurveiRams such as hardware, software, development, and manpower costs as well as any other expenses related to the project.

# '''Budget development and tracking''' <br> - OpenProject will be implemented to regularly monitor actual spending against the allocated budget and identify areas for improvement.

# '''Cost variance analysis''' <br> - The project team will analyze and distinguish between the actual cost in the budget and predicted cost estimates to pinpoint reasons for any discrepancies, then initiate remedial measures to align expenses accordingly.

# '''Cost management roles and responsibilities''' <br> - The project team members will define and establish clear roles and responsibilities for cost management.

# '''Approval process for changes'''  <br> - Changes to projects or budgets will be approved formally through an established and implemented procedure.

# '''Reporting and communication'''  <br> - Regular cost reports will be provided and distributed to the project team, project sponsor, and stakeholders to inform them of the project's financial situation. 

By implementing a clear cost management approach in SurveiRams, the project team can ensure that the project stays on budget and meets financial objectives. This can help to minimize the risk of cost overruns and ensure that the project is completed successfully.


==7.3.2 Measuring Project Costs==

For this project, the Earned Value Management tool will be used to measure project costs. Specifically, the Cost Variance (CV), Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Performance Index (CPI), and Schedule Performance Index (SPI) are the metrics to be used to aid in tracking whether the project is over or under budget, or whether the team is on schedule or not. 

<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">
<tr>
<td width="400" bgcolor="lightblue">
<p><strong>Metrics</strong></p>
</td>
<td width="190" bgcolor="lightblue">
<p><strong>Formula/Definition</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="400">
<p>Schedule Variance (SV)</p>
</td>
<td width="190">
<p>EV - PV</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="400">
<p>Cost Variance (CV)</p>
</td>
<td width="190">
<p>EV - AC</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="400">
<p>Schedule Performance Index (SPI)</p>
</td>
<td width="190">
<p>EV / PV</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="400">
<p>Cost Performance Index (CPI)</p>
</td>
<td width="190">
<p>EV / AC</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Table 1 shows the formula to calculate for each metric. SV is the difference between the EV (Earned Value) and PV (Planned Value). It will determine whether the project is ahead (SV > 0), right on track (SV = 0), or behind schedule (SV < 0) in a specific period or task. Meanwhile, CV is the difference between EV and AC (Actual Costs). This dictates whether the project is under budget (CV > 0), perfectly on budget (CV = 0), or over budget (CV < 0) during a certain period.

On the other hand, CPI is the ratio of the EV to the AC. This will help in checking if the project is cost-effective. If the CPI is:

* less than one (a negative number), then it means that the project is over budget so far

* equal to one (1), then it means that the project is perfectly on budget so far

* more than one (a positive number), then it means that the project is over budget so far

The Schedule Performance Index, which is the ratio of the EV to the PV, is like the SV, only in terms of the overall timeline. The aim is to consistently have an SPI that is either close to 1, or if possible, be a little under 1.

==7.3.3 Reporting Format==

Reporting on cost management will be included in the monthly project status report.  The Monthly Project Status Report will include a section labeled, “Cost Management”.  This section will contain the Earned Value Metrics identified in the previous section.  All cost variances outside the thresholds identified in this Cost Management Plan will be reported on including any corrective actions planned.  Change Requests which are triggered based upon project cost overruns will be identified and tracked in this report.

==7.3.4 Cost Variance Response Process==

The Control Thresholds for this project is a CPI or SPI of 1, as stated above in Measuring Project Cost. If the Project Sponsor selects a corrective action option, they may choose from the following:  
* Reducing the scope of the project 
* Reducing the quality of the project deliverables 
* Increasing the budget for the project 
* Increasing productivity or efficiency of project team members 

The Project Manager will monitor the implementation of the corrective actions and provide regular updates to the Project Sponsor on the status of the project budget. If the project continues to exceed the Control Thresholds, the Project Manager will forward the issue to their Project Adviser for further action.

==7.3.5 Cost Change Control Process==

The cost change control process will include the following steps:

# '''Identification of Cost Change''' <br> - The Project Manager or any team member who identifies and proposes a potential cost change must document and bring it to the attention of the Project Sponsor through a Cost Change Request Form.

# '''Analysis of the Cost Change''' <br> - The project team will analyze the cost change to determine its impact on the project schedule, budget, and overall performance. 

# '''Approval of the Cost Change'''  <br> - The Project Manager will present an analysis of the cost change to the Project Sponsor and other relevant stakeholders. The Project Sponsor will then approve or reject the cost change based on the analysis provided.

# '''Implementation of the Cost Change'''  <br> - Once the cost change is approved, the Project Manager will update the project cost baseline and implement the necessary cost changes to the project plan in accordance with the project schedule and budget.

# '''Tracking and Monitoring of the Cost Change'''  <br> - The Project Manager will track and monitor the cost change to ensure that it is implemented effectively and efficiently. The project team will regularly review the progress of the cost change and adjust as necessary.

# '''Reporting on the Cost Change''' <br> - The Project Manager will report on the cost change to the Project Sponsor and other stakeholders. The report will detail the factors contributing to the cost change, its implications for the project timeline, budget, and quality of work, as well as the progress achieved in managing the situation.

The cost change control process is a crucial aspect of managing the SurveiRams ticketing system project's financial aspects. By analyzing and approving cost changes, the project can ensure that it remains within the allocated budget and avoids any unexpected financial challenges. Regular reporting on cost changes will allow the project manager to keep the project sponsor and other key stakeholders informed of any financial updates and ensure transparency throughout the project's lifecycle. By adhering to this cost change control process, the SurveiRams ticketing system project can achieve its objectives and deliver quality results within the specified budget.

Table 7. Project Budget

Table 7 breaks down the details of the SurveiRams Project Budget.  The estimated Manpower Costs are based on Glassdoor, a website that provides information about job salaries depending on work experience and location. The data they provide are from the input of users, which gives it authenticity and legitimacy in the real-world scenario [14]. The salaries used were the base salaries for job seekers with 0-1 year of work experience, based in Manila, Philippines. Hardware prices were based on the website Gigahertz, a company dedicated to providing Filipinos affordable technology [15]. 

The office’s monthly rent in a building in Paranaque was based on Lamudi, a website where landlords, estate developers and agents list available properties [16]. The internet billings were based on Converge’s website. 



=7.4 SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLAN=

==7.4.1 Introduction==

Managing a project’s schedule is one of the most important things to do. Discussed in this document are Schedule Management Approach, Schedule Control, Schedule Changes and Thresholds, and Scope Change. These must be elaborated as schedules are not always set in stone. There are unforeseen risks that might occur that could offset a project’s schedule.  

==7.4.2 Schedule Management Approach==
Once a preliminary schedule has been produced, the project team will regularly review and update the schedule to ensure that the project stays on track. In addition to the project schedule, Earned Value Measures will be used to monitor and compare budgeted or scheduled progress against actual progress.

Any changes to the schedule will be communicated to all stakeholders promptly. Regular monitoring and tracking of the project will be done to ensure adherence to the schedule.

* The team will also utilize project management software to facilitate task tracking and ensure that deadlines are met.  
* The project manager will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the project against the schedule, identifying potential delays, and taking corrective action where necessary.  
* The team will also hold regular status meetings to discuss progress and identify any issues that need to be addressed.  
* The project manager will provide regular status reports to stakeholders, including the project sponsor, to keep them informed of the project's progress. 

==7.4.3 Schedule Control==
;Frequency of Updates and Reviews: 

:The project schedule will be updated on a weekly basis by the project manager. 
:A weekly schedule review meeting will be held to review the project's progress against the schedule.
:Any changes to the schedule will be communicated to the project team and stakeholders within 48 hours (about 2 days) of being made.

;Roles and Responsibilities: 

:The project manager is responsible for maintaining and updating the project schedule and communicating any changes to the team and stakeholders.
:To ensure optimal project management and successful project delivery, the project team must finish all the required deliverables on time.

;Communicating Schedule and Progress: 

:The project manager will regularly communicate the project schedule and progress to the project team and stakeholders.
:Progress reports will be provided weekly to stakeholders, highlighting any major accomplishments or issues that may impact the project schedule.
:The project manager will also provide a monthly schedule status report to stakeholders, which will include an updated schedule and any changes made during the month. 

In conclusion, effective schedule control is critical to the success of the SurveiRams project. By establishing clear roles and responsibilities and maintaining open communication with the project team and stakeholders, the project manager can ensure that the project stays on schedule and within budget. The latest schedule can be found in Appendix A.

==7.4.4 Schedule Changes and Thresholds==

Schedule changes and thresholds are critical elements of project management. It is essential to have a defined process in place to ensure that any schedule changes are well-documented and approved by the appropriate project stakeholders. Before making any changes to the schedule, the project team must complete the Schedule Change Request Form found in Appendix B. This form must include the proposed changes, justification for the changes, and the potential impact on the project's timeline, budget, and resources. The project sponsor must approve the schedule change request, and the updated schedule must be communicated to all relevant stakeholders. By following this process, the project team can ensure that all schedule changes are transparent, well-documented, and aligned with the project's goals and objectives.

The project manager is responsible for submitting a Schedule Change Request Form to the project sponsor for approval before making any changes to the project schedule. Once approved, the project manager will update the schedule and communicate the changes and their impact to the project team and stakeholders. All change requests will be archived in the project records repository.

==7.4.5 Scope Change==
The team will need to evaluate the impact of any change in project scope that is authorized by the project sponsor on the present timetable. When an issue arises in a project that requires a substantial revision of the project scope, a change proposal can be considered. The team should approach any modification carefully given that the outcome could have a favorable or negative impact on the project's advancement. Any team member may request modifications, but they must be submitted in the form of a project change request document to the project stakeholder.

=7.6 Change Management Plan=
==7.6.1 Introduction==
A well-defined change management plan is vital to the effective execution of any project, including the SurveiRams Tiketing System project. This plan establishes a structured approach for identifying, assessing, and implementing changes that may arise throughout the project lifecycle. It ensures that all modifications undergo thorough evaluation, remain within the project's scope, and are effectively communicated to stakeholders.

The change management strategy encompasses a defined process for submitting, evaluating, and approving changes. This process is communicated to all stakeholders, who are encouraged to submit their modification requests. The project team then assesses these requests, considering their impact on the project's schedule, cost, and quality. Approved changes are implemented in an organized and controlled manner, while rejected changes are documented and archived for future reference.

Understanding the importance of adhering to the established change management strategy is crucial as changes made outside of this framework can negatively impact the project's progress and outcome. All stakeholders must recognize this and be familiar with the change management process to ensure that the project stays on course and that any implemented changes actively contribute to its overall success.

==7.6.2 Change Control Board==
The Change Control Board consists of a designated group of stakeholders who can approve or reject changes related to the SurveiRams System. The following table provides a concise overview of everyone serving on the Change Control Board:

==7.6.4 Change Control Process==
The SurveiRams Ticketing System Project Change Management Process places emphasis on managing the scope and modifications through the change request method. The process outlines the steps involved in handling changes. The SurveiRams Project's Change Control Process adheres to the organization's standard change procedure for all projects. The project manager is responsible for executing the change management approach for each change request.

#'''Assessing the need for a change (Stakeholders):''' The change requestor will submit a completed change request form to the project manager.
#'''Keeping track of change requests (Project Manager, Change Coordinator):''' Throughout the project's lifecycle, the project manager and the change coordinator will maintain a log of all received change requests.
#'''Evaluating the change (Project Manager, Team, Requestor):''' The project manager will conduct a preliminary analysis of the change's impact on risk, cost, schedule, and scope. They will also consult with team members and the change requestor for further clarification.
#'''Sending the change request to CCB (Change Control Board) (Project Manager):''' The project manager will forward the change request and preliminary analysis to the CCB (Change Control Board) for review.
#'''Receiving the Change Request Decision (CCB):''' Based on the information provided, the CCB will deliberate on the proposed change and determine whether it will be approved.
#'''Implementing the modification (Project Manager):''' If the CCB approves a change, the project manager will update and establish new baselines for project documents.

=10. WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE=

==10.1 Introduction==

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) has been developed to help clarify the project's goals and scope. The project is divided into smaller, more manageable components called work packages by the WBS, each of which represents a specific task that must be completed to achieve the project's overall objectives. The WBS acts as a hierarchical structure that aids in establishing a project schedule, budget, and resource plan as well as assisting the project team in understanding the relationships between various work packages. It is an essential tool for managing and controlling the SurveiRams System project because it also aids in tracking progress and spotting potential risks and problems.

==10.3 Hierarchical Structure==

This is a hierarchical structure outlining the various stages involved in the SurveiRams System, a project management system that aims to manage violations and track progress of related projects. The structure starts with the initiation stage, which involves creating a business case and conducting a feasibility study, followed by the development of a project charter and plan, analysis, design, testing, implementation, and finally, the close of the project. Each stage is further broken down into sub-stages, which provide detailed information on the specific tasks and responsibilities that need to be carried out to achieve the overall goal of the project. This structure is designed to ensure that the project is completed efficiently, effectively, and within the specified timeline and budget.
