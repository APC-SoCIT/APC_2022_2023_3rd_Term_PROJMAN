*More sustainable and cost-effective: By digitizing the current system, the project can eliminate the need for excessive paperwork, making the entire process more sustainable and cost-effective in the long run. 

''' COST '''

*Cost Savings: SurveiRams reduces the use of paper. This also results in cost savings and increased productivity. Paperless documentation increases the efficiency of data transmission by reducing paperwork and physical contact like couriers and printers. 

*Cloud Cost: According to Amazon AWS Pricing in the Asia Pacific region, their cloud storage will cost $0.025 (PHP 1.38) per GB for the first 50 TB and will cost $0.024 (PHP 1.33) per GB on the next 450 TB. This will be cheaper than physical storage in the long run. 

==4.7 Alternatives Analysis==

*Status Quo – One alternative to this project is keeping the current system. This means that no changes in personnel or materials will occur. Sticking to the status quo was rejected as an option, as this system proved to be tedious and time-consuming. 
*Modification of Current System – Another alternative for SurveiRams is simply adding some minor changes to their current system, but will not be digitized. An example of this is removing the logbook from the process and having the guards directly log their reports on an Incident Report form. This is also not a viable option because it is still going to be time-consuming. The forms will still be then digitized by the concerned office.

This will ensure that the project team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the scope at each stage of the project.

==7.2 Scope Management Approach==

* Mr. Ian Onrubia, the designated Project Manager, will work closely with Mr. Jojo Castillo, the project sponsor, and other key stakeholders to define and effectively manage the scope of the project, as well as oversee the fulfillment of all project requirements and ensure that the project deliverables are accepted and approved by the project sponsor and relevant stakeholders, with successful completion of the project dependent on the acceptance of all deliverables and resolution of any outstanding issues. 

* The scope of the SurveiRams project will be defined using various documents such as a Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, and a detailed Statement of Work (SOW), with regular reviews conducted throughout the project to ensure alignment with objectives and proper documentation of any changes. To measure and verify the scope, quality checklists will be developed, a scope baseline will be established, and work performance measurements will be used to track any progress. The Project Manager will submit a formal request for scope change, which the project sponsor will approve after evaluating it for alignment with the project goals, impacts on schedule and budget, and contribution to project success, ensuring only approved changes are made. 

==7.3 Roles and Responsibilities==

==7.4 Scope Definition==

The scope definition process for the project "SurveiRams” was developed based on the requirements identified during the requirements definition process. The following documents were used as references: Requirements Documentation, Requirements Management Plan and a Requirements Traceability Matrix. 

To define the project's scope, we used the following tools and techniques: feedback analysis, product analysis, and facilitated interviews. The team utilized adviser judgment to assess the feasibility of the project and identify potential risks. Product analysis was conducted to determine the features and functions required by the new system. Facilitated interviews were also conducted with stakeholders to gather their inputs and ensure their requirements were considered. 

Based on the analysis and input gathered, the following deliverables were defined as part of the project scope: 
SurveiRams should include the following features: 

*Ticketing database 

*Performance evaluation 

*Reporting and analytics 

*User training and support 

The scope definition process was tied back to the requirements definition process, ensuring that the project scope met all the identified requirements. Additionally, the Project Charter and Preliminary Project Scope Statement were also referred to during the scope definition process.

==7.6 Work Breakdown Structure==

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Work Breakdown Structure Dictionary are key elements to effective scope management.  This section should discuss how the project scope is to be subdivided into smaller deliverables in the WBS and WBS Dictionary and how these smaller components are managed during the life of the project.   

<img src="https://github.com/apcjlquesada/APC_2022_2023_T3_PROJMAN_MI202_G03_KAYVI_byte/blob/main/wiki_images/WBS.png" alt="WBS" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;">

==7.7 Scope Verification ==

The project team will use various techniques for scope verification to guarantee that the SurveiRams System project deliverables satisfy the original scope. These methods include: 

===7.7.1 Quality Checklists===

The project team will use checklists that outline the essential requirements for each deliverable to be accepted. These checklists will be employed to ensure that each deliverable satisfies all necessary criteria before progressing. 

===7.7.2 Work Performance Measurements===

The team will use work performance measurements to monitor and gauge the advancement of each deliverable during the development phase. This approach will enable the team to detect any possible issues or deviations from the original scope and take prompt corrective measures. 

===7.7.3 Scope Baseline===

The team will establish a scope baseline, which captures a snapshot of the initial project scope. Any modifications to the scope must be recorded and authorized before being implemented. The scope baseline will be employed to ensure that the final deliverables align with the original project scope. 

===7.7.4 Formal Acceptance===

Each deliverable will be formally accepted by the project sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders upon completion. This ensures that the project team meets the expectations of all relevant parties and allows any necessary feedback or changes to be made promptly. 

Overall, it is critical that the project team maintains open communication and cooperation with the client and other stakeholders throughout the project to ensure that the deliverables meet the original scope and are formally approved. 

==7.8 Scope Control==
The change management plan must be consulted in the event of the desire to change the project scope. The procedures written there will be followed. The change’s impact on the schedule and budget will be factored into making the decision. Should any changes happen, all project documents related will be updated. 

=8. COST MANAGEMENT PLAN=

==8.1 Introduction==

The purpose of the Cost Management Plan for the SurveiRams System project is to ensure that all project-related expenses are managed efficiently throughout its entire duration. The plan outlines the techniques and guidelines that will be employed to gauge, communicate, and regulate project expenses. 

# '''Cost management responsibilities''' <br> - The Project Manager will be responsible for managing the project's expenses and act as the contact for any cost-related concerns. The Project Leader, on the other hand, will be responsible for supervising project spendings and making sure that it stays within the authorized budget. 

# '''Cost change approval''' <br> - Authorization from the Project Manager is required prior to implementing any changes in cost. In case the cost modification exceeds 10% of the total project budget, approval from the Project Sponsor must be obtained before executing it. 

# '''Cost measurement and reporting''' <br> - The budget will be presented in a simplified and concise format by utilizing a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel. The budget will be divided into distinct line items, with each item having a detailed cost estimate. It will be updated once there are any changes, and any changes made will be indicated.  

Overall, the objective of the Cost Management Plan for the SurveiRams System project is to ensure that all project-related expenses are effectively monitored and controlled, allowing the project to be completed within the assigned budget. This approach will ensure the project's successful and timely completion. 


==8.2 Cost Management Approach==
The cost management approach for SurveiRams will be based on the following principles: 

# '''Clear definition of cost'''  <br> - The project team will define all the costs associated with SurveiRams. Hardware and software costs, development costs,  and manpower costs, and any other expenses related to the project. 

# '''Budget development and tracking''' <br> - An effective budget tracking system will be implemented to regularly monitor actual spending against the allocated budget and identify areas for improvement. 

# '''Cost estimates''' <br> - The project team will utilize diverse methods of cost estimation to guarantee that the allocated budget is precise and feasible. 

# '''Cost variance analysis''' <br> - The project team will analyze and distinguish between the actual cost in the budget and predicted cost estimates to pinpoint reasons for any discrepancies, then initiate remedial measures to align expenses accordingly. 

# '''Cost management roles and responsibilities''' <br> - The project team members will define and establish clear roles and responsibilities for cost management. 

# '''Approval process for changes'''  <br> - Changes to projects or budgets will be approved formally through an established and implemented procedure. 

# '''Reporting and communication'''  <br> - Regular cost reports will be provided and distributed to the project team, project sponsor, and management to inform every one of the project's financial situations. 

By implementing a clear cost management approach in SurveiRams, the project team can help ensure that the project stays on budget and meets financial objectives. This can help to minimize the risk of cost overruns and ensure that the project is completed successfully. 


==8.3 Measuring Project Costs==

This section defines how the project’s costs will be measured.  The PMBOK focuses on Earned Value Management for measuring and controlling a project’s costs.  Earned Value Management is a broad and powerful tool; as such, we recommend that all project managers take some formal courses in Earned Value Management.

In this section you should detail how you will measure the project costs. What Earned Value measurements will be captured and reported upon. Will you use any tools, such as project management software, to assist in capturing Earned Value metrics? How will you forecast future project costs? Will you review cost performance over time, across work packages or schedule activities?

Our example in this section measures four Earned Value measurements; Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Variance (CV), Schedule Performance Index (SPI) and Cost Performance Index (CPI). For most typical projects these four measurements can provide enough insight for effective management without overburdening the Project Manager with Earned Value calculations and measurements.

Schedule Variance (SV) is a measurement of the schedule performance for a project. It’s calculated by taking the Earned Value (EV) and subtracting the Planned Value (PV). Since EV is the actual value earned in the project and the PV is the value our project plan says we should have earned at this point, when we subtract what we planned from the actual we have a good measurement which tells us if we are ahead or behind the baseline schedule according to our project plan. If SV is zero, then the project is perfectly on schedule. If SV is greater than zero, the project is earning more value than planned thus it’s ahead of schedule. If SV is less than zero, the project is earning less value than planned thus it’s behind schedule.

Cost Variance (CV) is a measurement of the budget performance for a project. CV is calculated by subtracting Actual Costs (AC) from Earned Value (EV). As we already know, EV is the actual value earned in the project. AC is the actual costs incurred to date, thus when we subtract what our actual costs from the EV we have a good measurement which tells us if we are above or below budget. If CV is zero, then the project is perfectly on budget. If CV is greater than zero, the project is earning more value than planned thus it’s under budget. If CV is less than zero, the project is earning less value than planned thus it’s over budget.

The Schedule Performance Index (SPI) measures the progress achieved against that which was planned. SPI is calculated as EV/PV. If EV is equal to PV the value of the SPI is 1. If EV is less than the PV then the value is less than 1, which means the project is behind schedule. If EV is greater than the PV the value of the SPI is greater than one, which means the project is ahead of schedule. A well performing project should have its SPI as close to 1 as possible, or maybe even a little under 1.

Cost Performance Index (CPI) measures the value of the work completed compared to the actual cost of the work completed. CPI is calculated as EV/AC. If CPI is equal to 1 the project is perfectly on budget. If the CPI is greater than 1 the project is under budget, if it’s less than 1 the project is over budget.


==8.4 Reporting Format==

Reporting on cost management will be included in the monthly project status report.  The Monthly Project Status Report will include a section labeled, “Cost Management”.  This section will contain the Earned Value Metrics identified in the previous section.  All cost variances outside of the thresholds identified in this Cost Management plan will be reported on including any corrective actions which are planned.  Change Requests which are triggered based upon project cost overruns will be identified and tracked in this report. 

==8.5 Cost Variance Response Process==

The Control Thresholds for this project is a CPI or SPI of 1, as stated above in the Measuring Project Cost. 

If the Project Sponsor selects a corrective action option,   
The corrective actions may include: 

* Reducing the scope of the project 
* Reducing the quality of the project deliverables 
* Increasing the budget for the project 
* Increasing productivity or efficiency of project team members 

==8.6 Cost Change Control Process==

The cost change control process will include the following steps: 

# '''Identification of Cost Change''' <br> - The Project Manager or any team member who identifies and proposes a potential cost change must document and bring it to the attention of the Project Sponsor through a cost change request form. 

# '''Analysis of the Cost Change''' <br> - The project team will analyze the cost change to determine its impact on the project schedule, budget, and overall performance.  

# '''Approval of the Cost Change'''  <br> - The Project Manager will present an analysis of the cost change to the Project Sponsor and other relevant stakeholders. The Project Sponsor will then approve or reject the cost change based on the analysis provided. 

# '''Implementation of the Cost Change'''  <br> - Once the cost change is approved, the Project Manager will update the project cost baseline and implement the necessary cost changes to the project plan in accordance with the project schedule and budget. 

# '''Tracking and Monitoring of the Cost Change'''  <br> - The Project Manager will track and monitor the cost change to ensure that it is implemented effectively and efficiently. The project team will regularly review the progress of the cost change and adjust as necessary. 

# '''Reporting on the Cost Change''' <br> - The Project Manager will report on the cost change to the Project Sponsor and other stakeholders. The report will detail the factors contributing to the cost change, its implications for the project timeline, budget, and quality of work, as well as the progress achieved in managing the situation. 

The cost change control process is a crucial aspect of managing the SurveiRams ticketing system project's financial aspects. By analyzing and approving cost changes, the project can ensure that it remains within the allocated budget and avoids any unexpected financial challenges. Regular reporting on cost changes will allow the project manager to keep the project sponsor and other key stakeholders informed of any financial updates and ensure transparency throughout the project's lifecycle. By adhering to this cost change control process, the SurveiRams ticketing system project can achieve its objectives and deliver quality results within the specified budget. 


==8.7 Project Budget==


=9. SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLAN=

==9.1 Introduction==

Managing a project’s schedule is one of the most important things to do. Discussed in this document are Schedule Management Approach, Schedule Control, Schedule Changes and Thresholds, and Scope Change. These must be elaborated as schedules are not always set in stone. There are unforeseen risks that might occur that could offset a project’s schedule.

==9.2 Schedule Management Approach==
Once a preliminary schedule has been produced, the project team will regularly review and update the schedule to ensure that the project stays on track. In addition to the project schedule, Earned Value Measures will be used to monitor and compare budgeted or scheduled progress against actual progress. 

Any changes to the schedule will be communicated to all stakeholders in a timely manner. Regular monitoring and tracking of the project will be done to ensure adherence to the schedule. 

* The team will also utilize project management software to facilitate task tracking and ensure that deadlines are met.  
* The project manager will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the project against the schedule, identifying potential delays, and taking corrective action where necessary.  
* The team will also hold regular status meetings to discuss progress and identify any issues that need to be addressed.  
* The project manager will provide regular status reports to stakeholders, including the project sponsor, to keep them informed of the project's progress. 

==9.3 Schedule Control==
;Frequency of Updates and Reviews: 

:The project schedule will be updated on a weekly basis by the project manager. 
:A schedule review meeting will be held every week to review the progress of the project against the schedule. 
:Any changes to the schedule will be communicated to the project team and stakeholders within 48 hours of being made. 

;Roles and Responsibilities: 

:The project manager is responsible for maintaining and updating the project schedule, as well as communicating any changes to the team and stakeholders. 
:To ensure optimal project management and successful project delivery, the project team must finish all the required deliverables on time. 
:The project team is responsible for providing accurate and timely information to the project manager to help ensure the schedule is up-to-date and on track. 
:Stakeholders are responsible for reviewing the project schedule and providing feedback or concerns to the project manager in a timely manner. 

;Communicating Schedule and Progress: 

:The project manager will communicate the project schedule and progress to the project team and stakeholders on a regular basis. 
:Progress reports will be provided weekly to stakeholders, highlighting any major accomplishments or issues that may impact the project schedule. 
:The project manager will also provide a monthly schedule status report to stakeholders, which will include an updated schedule and any changes made during the month. 

In conclusion, effective schedule control is critical to the success of the SurveiRams project. By establishing clear roles and responsibilities and maintaining open communication with the project team and stakeholders, the project manager can ensure that the project stays on schedule and within budget. 

==9.4 Schedule Changes and Thresholds==

Schedule changes and thresholds are critical elements of project management. It is essential to have a defined process in place to ensure that any schedule changes are well-documented and approved by the appropriate project stakeholders. Before making any changes to the schedule, the project team must complete the "Schedule Change" form. This form must include the proposed changes, justification for the changes, and the potential impact on the project's timeline, budget, and resources. The project sponsor must approve the schedule change request, and the updated schedule must be communicated to all relevant stakeholders. By following this process, the project team can ensure that all schedule changes are transparent, well-documented, and aligned with the project's goals and objectives. 
 
The project manager is responsible for submitting a "Schedule Change" form to the project sponsor for approval before making any changes to the project schedule. Once approved, the project manager will update the schedule and communicate the changes and their impact to the project team and stakeholders. All change requests will be archived in the project records repository. 

==9.5 Scope Change==
The team will need to evaluate the impact of any change in project scope that is authorized by the project sponsor on the present timetable. When an issue arises in a project that requires a substantial revision of the project scope, a change proposal can be considered. The team should approach any modification carefully given that the outcome could have a favorable or negative impact on the project's advancement. Any team member may request modifications, but they must be submitted in the form of a project change request document to the project stakeholder. 

=10. WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE=

==10.1 Introduction==

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) has been developed to help clarify the project's goals and scope. The project is divided into smaller, more manageable components called work packages by the WBS, each of which represents a specific task that must be completed to achieve the project's overall objectives. The WBS acts as a hierarchical structure that aids in establishing a project schedule, budget, and resource plan as well as assisting the project team in understanding the relationships between various work packages. It is an essential tool for managing and controlling the SurveiRams System project because it also aids in tracking progress and spotting potential risks and problems.

=13. RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN=
==13.1 Introduction==
SurveiRams is a mobile application designed to develop a centralized system for Asia Pacific College’s (APC) Information Technology Resources Office (ITRO), Management Office (BMO), and Security Office. The application will assist them in managing incident reports and logs as well as provide insights.

The Risk Management Plan is important for projects following the Agile Methodology to use as a guide on how to identify and respond to risks. The team must enumerate potential risks, plan for responses, and monitor and control said risks from the project’s start to finish. Upon completion, the plan will be used every day, and may be revised to fit the project’s needs better, thus ensuring that the objectives of the project are achieved on time within budget.

Contents of this document include a summary of the risk management process, describing the sequence of steps as well as who is assigned to do so. Next is a guide for what constitutes as a risk and their hierarchy. Followed by this is the monitoring and controlling process for the risks, and last is the risk register.
   
To further develop a risk management plan for the SurveiRams System, the following information should be considered:   
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>'''Identifying and Assessing Risks'''</td>
      <td>The teams must enumerate potential risks to all phases of the project, such as technical issues, company policies, cybersecurity, time constraint, and human factors. These should then be assessed by the probability of their occurrence, as well as the scale of impact they may have.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>'''Risk Mitigation Strategies'''</td>
      <td>After identifying and assessing risks, the project team should develop a plan for mitigating or avoiding the risks. Mitigation strategies should be prioritized based on their effectiveness in reducing risk and their feasibility in terms of time and cost. Strategies may include contingency planning, redundancy, and the development of fallback procedures.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>'''Contingency Planning'''</td>
      <td>The project team should develop contingency plans for significant risks that could significantly impact the project's success. Contingency plans should outline the steps required to minimize the impact of the risk and maintain the project's progress. These plans should be regularly reviewed and updated as the project progresses, and new risks are identified.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>'''Communication and Reporting'''</td>
      <td>The project team should establish a clear communication and reporting framework for risk management. This framework should ensure that risks are regularly reviewed, and the project team is updated on any changes to the risk landscape. Communication should occur between project managers, team members, and stakeholders.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>'''Risk Monitoring and Review'''</td>
      <td>Risk management is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and review. The project team should establish a regular review process to ensure that risk management strategies remain effective, risks are updated, and new risks are identified. The review process should be transparent, with all stakeholders being updated on any changes.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
By considering these additional factors in a risk management plan, the SurveiRams System project team can ensure that the project is completed successfully, meeting all objectives while minimizing potential risks.   

==13.2 Top Three Risks==
Every project has risks whether foreseen or not. However, in the situation of the SurveiRams project, the three biggest foreseen risks are the following:
# '''Technical Risks''' – Risks that are brought by evolving technology, such as failure from either or both software and hardware and cyberattacks resulting in data loss and/or security breaches.
# '''Insufficient Resources''' – Risks that are brought by the lack of project resources such as exceeding the project timeline or going over budget, which may delay the completion.
# '''Human Error''' – Risks that are brought by the unavoidable mistakes made by humans involved in the project such as the project team, stakeholders, and personnel.

==13.3 Risk Management Approach==
Agile risk management values lean thinking and efficient communication. This means that for the SurveiRams risk management strategy, the focus will be data gathering and analysis before deciding on a course of action. Stakeholders, sponsors, and the project team must cooperate with each other for the risk management approach.

Specifically, these are the steps to be followed:   
* '''Risk Identification:''' Meetings will be held to discuss relevant risks encountered based from experience in other projects, and a Risk Register will be put together.
* '''Risk Assessment:''' A Risk Assessment Matrix will be constructed to rank the risks discussed based on the probability of its occurrence as well as the gravity of its impact on the project.
* '''Risk Mitigation:''' Mitigation plans will be made for the risks that have a high probability and extreme gravity, which include how to prevent them and minimize their impact. 
* '''Risk Monitoring:''' There might be unforeseen risks that could arise. To be ready to minimize or eliminate them, there will be a bi-monthly examination of the Risk Register, as well as another round of brainstorming for possible risks that haven’t been discussed. New risks discovered will be added to the Risk Register.
* '''Risk Communication:''' All stakeholders must regularly keep contact to be informed about the occurrences of risks and how they are handled. They must also be updated regarding changes in the risk management plan and process.

==13.4 Risk Identification==
After a thorough discussion with the project team, risks to SurveiRams were identified. The team organized these risks into the following categories:
* '''Technical:''' Risks related to technology 
* '''Cost:''' Risks related to the project budget
* '''Schedule:''' Risks related to the project timeline
* '''Communication:''' Risks related to communication among all stakeholders
* '''Skills Resource:''' Risks related to the project team’s skills and expertise
* '''Strategic:''' Risks related to the project team’s approach in accomplishing the project
* '''External Hazard:''' Risks related to nature, society, and the government

These are all the possible types of risks that could affect the project. Updates will be made in the event that another type is discovered. Specific risks under these categories will be discussed in the Risk Register below.

==13.5 Risk Qualification and Prioritization== 
A Risk Assessment Matrix based on probability and impact was created to aid in ranking the risks in the Risk Register.
<img src="https://github.com/apcjlquesada/APC_2022_2023_3rd_Term_PROJMAN/assets/97137055/7ee3c489-4c79-41f5-87e2-3884eb0ca07b" alt="Image description" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:30%;">
We have categorized the risks into four categories: Extreme, High, Medium, Low, and Negligible.   
   
The probability of risks happening and their impact on the project is described below:   
* Extreme: Risks with a very high probability of occurring and a severe impact on the project.
* High: Risks with a high probability of occurring and a significant impact on the project. These risks require immediate attention, and we need to develop mitigation strategies for them.  
* Medium: Risks with a medium probability of occurring and a moderate impact on the project. These risks should be closely monitored, and mitigation strategies should be developed in case they occur. 
* Low: Risks with a low probability of occurring and a minor impact on the project. These risks can be monitored periodically, and mitigation strategies can be developed in case they occur.
* Negligible: Risks with a very low probability of occurring and negligible impact on the project. These risks can be ignored.

The following are the identified risks and their prioritization based on probability and impact:   

'''Technical Risks:'''
* High probability and high impact   
* Lack of technical expertise to develop the system
* Failure of the new system to integrate with the current systems   
''' Resource Risks:'''   
* Medium probability and medium impact
* Inadequate resources for the project
'''Security Risks:'''
* Medium probability and medium impact 
* Unauthorized access to the system  

Based on the above prioritization, we will focus on developing mitigation strategies for the extreme and high priority risks first. We will continuously monitor the medium and low priority risks and develop mitigation strategies if required. The negligible priority risks will be ignored as they have a very low probability of occurring and have a negligible impact on the project.   
   
We will align this risk qualification and prioritization with the risk management plan of agile by regularly reviewing and updating the risk register throughout the project. We will also ensure that risks are included in sprint planning, so the team is aware of the risks and can plan accordingly. Additionally, we will encourage the team to identify and report any new risks they may come across during the project.   

==13.6 Risk Monitoring== 
The Agile Risk Management Plan of the Dispatch Directory System provides a framework for actively monitoring risks throughout the project. To achieve this, it is essential to continuously monitor risks during the project's entire life cycle and carefully document the process, including identifying conditions that may trigger risks.   
   
As part of the plan, the project manager will incorporate the high-scoring risks into the project schedule and assign a risk manager to oversee their monitoring. This will help the project manager determine when the risks require close attention and when the risk manager should report updates at the bi-weekly project team meetings. The risk manager will be responsible for keeping track of the risk trigger conditions.   
   
Furthermore, the project manager will make certain that the project team is aware of the identified risks and their potential impact on the project. The project team will be encouraged to notify the risk manager of any new risks or changes to existing risks, who will then assess and prioritize them accordingly.   
   
At bi-weekly team meetings, the risk manager will report on the status of identified risks, any new risks, and the effectiveness of mitigation plans. Any changes to the risk management plan that are required will be made in collaboration with the project team.   
   
In conclusion, the project team will implement the agile risk management methodology that emphasizes ongoing improvement and flexibility. The effectiveness of the risk management plan will be regularly assessed and adjusted as needed to ensure the project's objectives and quality standards will be an achievement.   

==13.7 Risk Mitigation and Avoidance== 
The risk management plan will be created by the project team based on the importance given to each risk. To prepare for probable delays, strategies could include creating backup plans, assigning more resources, or modifying project timetables. The project team will work with stakeholders to put mitigation techniques into place and continuously assess their efficacy.   
   
The first step in risk mitigation and avoidance is to identify and prioritize the potential risks. The project team should identify the risks with the highest probability and impact and develop strategies to mitigate or avoid them. The following are the key considerations and options available to the project manager:   
* '''Resource Allocation:''' It is crucial for the project to be successful and efficient that the project manager guarantees the team has the required resources, including proficiency, abilities, and knowledge, as well as access to tools and equipment. The project manager bears the responsibility of ensuring that these resources are available to the team to finish the project within the given budget and timeline.   
* '''Risk Assessment:''' The team should thoroughly analyze potential risks to effectively anticipate and address them. The project manager should complete the risk assessment early in the project and take prompt actions to identify and mitigate potential risks.   
* '''Contingency Planning:''' In order to be prepared for potential risks, the project team needs to come up with backup plans for contingencies. It's up to the project manager to supervise the development, testing, and confirmation of these plans for every potential risk.   
* '''Communication:''' To minimize risks and prevent misunderstandings, it's important for the project manager to promote clear and open communication between the project team, clients, and stakeholders.  
* '''Agile Approach:''' Using the Agile approach offers a flexible and responsive way to manage risks. The project manager needs to ensure that the team follows the Agile methodology, which enables ongoing risk management and the ability to adapt to changes.  
* '''Change Management:''' The Dispatch Directory System project should have a clear change management process in place to handle any unexpected changes. The project team must document, communicate, and obtain approval from relevant stakeholders for any changes. This will help the project manager to effectively manage and prevent potential risks, and successfully complete the project.

==13.8 Risk Register== 
From other part: The risk register is updated regularly to ensure that new risks are identified, and existing risks are managed effectively. The project team will continue to monitor and manage risks throughout the project lifecycle.   
   

The risk register, which will be kept up to date throughout the project, will include a thorough explanation of each risk, its likelihood, and potential effects, as well as any mitigation measures taken. To make sure the risk register appropriately reflects the project's current condition, it will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis. All stakeholders will have access to the risk registry, which will be kept in a central location.   
   
This risk management strategy, which emphasizes early and frequent risk identification, collaborative risk management, and ongoing risk monitoring, is generally in line with the Agile methodology. The Dispatch Directory System project team can lessen the effects of probable risks and raise the possibility that the project will succeed by anticipating and resolving them. Furthermore, the risk register for the Dispatch Directory System project will be kept in a shared document with the help of a cloud-based project management tool like Jira, Asana, or Trello. The project team will use this tool to track and prioritize risks, assign responsibilities, and track progress in risk mitigation.   
   
The following criteria will be used for the risk register:   
* Risk ID - each risk will be assigned a unique identifier.
* Risk Description - there will be a clear and concise description of the risk event. 
* Risk Category - will classify risks into technical, organizational, or legal categories.
* Risk Owner - will be responsible for monitoring and managing each risk.
* Probability - likelihood of a risk occurring is assessed using a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the lowest likelihood and 5 indicating the highest.
* Impact - the risk's potential impact on the project is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the least significant impact and 5 indicating the most significant impact. 
* Risk Score - the probability and impact scores are multiplied to determine the overall risk score. 
* Mitigation Strategy - outlines the specific measures to be taken to mitigate the risk. 
* Status - risk's current status, whether it is open, in progress, or closed, is also documented.   
* Target Resolution Date - anticipated date for risk resolution to be resolved.

==14.7 Communication Methods and Technologies==
To prevent misunderstandings, the team must maintain open communication with the stakeholders. To avoid this, the team must notify the stakeholders of the status of the project and what is happening with the system's development to keep them informed. Progress reports, problems, updates, and other pertinent information they need to be aware of all the source of updates. On the other hand, choosing the team's preferred method of communication requires careful consideration of both cost and security.
	
Factors to be considered in determining the best communication methods and technologies for the SurveiRams system:   
'''Stakeholder’s Preference'''
:: Stakeholders may prefer to meet online or face-to-face. It really depends on what mode of communication they want. Either way, if they want to meet online, the team may set a meeting through Microsoft Teams.
'''Type of Information'''
:: The team may just send an email with the links of their documents for the stakeholders to consult with that does not require a meeting. 
'''Budget and Resources Available'''
:: The chosen method of communication should be aligned with the budget. 
    
Therefore, the SurveiRams System suggests using a combination of project management software, email, and video conferencing apps like Microsoft Teams to keep the stakeholders updated and achieve the project's goals.

=15. PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT PLAN=
==15.1 Introduction==
The project's success depends on the Procurement Management Plan. The procurement requirements for the project are outlined in this plan, with how the procurement process will be managed from the creation of procurement paperwork to the conclusion of contracts. This strategy attempts to assure that all necessary materials are acquired within the budget, on schedule and in accordance with the level of quality needed for the project. The kinds of items that need to be acquired, the justifications and timetables to accomplish, the contract types to be used, the risks connected to procurement management, and how these risks will be addressed are all specified in this strategy. It also describes how to determine costs and evaluate vendors, including how to use templates and other forms of standard procurement.   

Management of vendors, a crucial step in the procurement process, is also included in this strategy. In addition, it identifies any qualified sellers if necessary. The plan includes performance metrics for procurement operations in order to guarantee that the procurement procedure is monitored and controlled throughout the project's life cycle.   
   
To summarize, Procurement Management Plan’s objective is to have an efficient and effective completion on the project’s procurement requirements while giving a priority on the quality, cost, and schedule. This management provides a roadmap of the procurement process, for stakeholders to be aware and informed of what is happening in the development.

==15.2 Procurement Risks==
Procurement in every project is a vital component that should be taken with care because it involves budget in acquiring goods, services or work from external sources.  Having risks in the procurement may negatively impact the development. Therefore, it is an issue that should be addressed to minimize the impact on the project.
   
The SurveiRams System incorporates procurement processes that entail a number of hazards, including but not exclusive to the following:   
* Delivery of services or goods within the project timeline from vendor may result in increased costs.
* The absence of competition in the market may lead to higher prices or reduced quality of goods and services.
* Commitments with the vendor and procurement activities may be compromised when there will be a sudden change in the project scope, schedule or budget.
* Misunderstandings between the project team and the vendor may arise when there are no clear specifications, lack of documents and incorrect assumptions.
* Poor communication with the vendor may lead to misunderstandings.
* Vendor does not comply with the regulatory requirements or legal issues, which may impact the project, team and stakeholder’s reputation.
* Inadequate vendor selection or evaluation may result into partnering with unreliable sources that has a low quality of goods or services.
* Contract management oversight may lead the vendor’s services or goods and the project team’s development to fail.

To mitigate these risks, the Procurement Management Plan includes detailed strategies for risk identification, assessment, and mitigation. The team will consistently monitor the plan throughout the project’s duration to specify and address the risks. Moreover, the team will impose accurate procurement processes to control the potential risks associated with procurement management.

==15.3 Procurement Risk Management==
1.  Identification of Procurement Risks  
The first step in managing procurement risks is to identify and assess them. For the SurveiRams System, potential procurement risks include: 
* Unexpected increase in the cost of goods or services
* Delays in the delivery of goods or services
* Vendor bankruptcy 
* Incomplete or substandard goods or services  
* Unclear or insufficient contract terms and conditions 
* Misalignment of the vendor’s goals with the project
* Inaccurate estimates of costs and timelines  
* Insufficient supplier qualifications

2.  Risk Mitigation Strategies  
After identifying the potential procurement risks, it is ideal to plot a strategy to mitigate them. For the SurveiRams System, the following risk mitigation strategies will be put into action:
* Regularly monitoring and evaluating the vendor’s performance to ensure that they adhere the project and the team’s standards.
* Implement an effective contract management practice to prevent vagueness and ensure clear information.
* Conducting research in the market to identify lists of reliable vendors with a good track record in delivering high-quality goods or services.
* Establishing a clear delivery schedules, specifications and performance criteria for the procurement plan.
* Developing a comprehensive contract terms and conditions that protects the interests of the project and the team.
* Having a contingency plan to address potential vendor bankruptcy.
* Conducting a regular risk assessment in the procurement process to identify and address emerging risks.  
3.  Assignment of Responsibilities 
Every person in the team should be given a clear assignment of duties for controlling procurement risks. The procurement manager will be in charge of identifying and evaluating procurement risks for the SurveiRams System, creating risk mitigation plans, and keeping an eye on risk throughout the procurement process. Project manager and the team’s input and feedback on procurement risk management strategies are also valuable and essential.
 
4.  Communication and Reporting  
Communication and reporting in the process of procurement risk management is valuable. The regular updates on the procurement risks and risks mitigation activities will be provided to the team. Moreover, communication plan is developed for the stakeholders to keep informed in any changes or developments made in the procurement risk management.

5.  Continuous Improvement  
To improve future procurement planning and execution, lessons acquired from risk management and procurement operations will be recorded and communicated to the project team. It should be a constant practice to improve procurement risk management.
  
In order to identify areas for improvement, procurement risk management operations will also be regularly reviewed.     

==15.4 Cost Determination==
Determining costs is a key component of the SurveiRams System procurement process. The team will employ a thorough cost determination procedure to choose the providers who are both competent and cost-efficient. As part of the cost estimation process, potential suppliers are asked to submit quotes, proposals, or bids in response to an RFP (Request for Proposal). The team must assess the costs related to the procurement process, such as acquisition, delivery, installation, and maintenance costs. The group will evaluate potential cost overruns as well as suggest measures to reduce them. To promote openness and equity in the selection process, the project team will make cost one of the primary deciding factors.    

The cost determination process will involve a number of stakeholders, such as procurement managers, project managers, and financial analysts. These parties will work together to make sure that the procurement budget is continuously tracked and that all expenditures are accurately estimated. The project team will use standardized procurement templates and papers to speed up the cost estimation procedure. This will make it easier to guarantee that all cost estimates are accurate and consistent across all procurement operations. The project team will also construct procurement performance measures to evaluate the efficiency of the cost estimation procedure.  
   
Overall, the procurement management plan's cost determination section will be extremely important in ensuring that the SurveiRams System is completed successfully and within the allotted budget. 

==15.5 Procurement Constraints==
The following constraints must be considered as part of the SurveiRams project’s procurement management process:   
# '''Budget Constraint:''' The project must be completed within a specific budgetary limit. This constraint ensures that the procurement process and subsequent implementation of the web application are cost-effective and aligned with the available financial resources.
