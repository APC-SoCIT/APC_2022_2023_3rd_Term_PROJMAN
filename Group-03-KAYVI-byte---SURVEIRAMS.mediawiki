<p><strong>Brief Background:</strong></p>
<p></p>

=Business Case=
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>This business case outlines how the Rams Violation Management System (RVMS) will address current business concerns, the benefits of the project, and recommendations and justification of the project. The business case also discusses detailed project goals, performance measures, assumptions, constraints, and alternative options. RVMS is the culmination of all the possible solutions the researchers acquired through carefully analyzing the stakeholder’s pain points. The system consists of three functions that will work together to serve and make the stakeholder’s processes more efficient and digitalized. The suggested project will be more than just a system but rather a long-term solution that the stakeholder and his successors may utilize and swiftly improve over time.</p>

<h2>Issue</h2>

<p>Paperwork and other materials generated by the Discipline Office (DO) tend to pile up. Physical storage requirements for written documents soon outgrow the office’s ability to archive data, resulting in an inefficient use of their storage capacity as well as adding cost to resources. With time, paper-based documentation will be in concern with how they accumulate with time as transporting document can be tedious, time-consuming, and wasteful. The current student violation reporting and encoding of blue slips, lacks a specialized digital system that automates and documents all the information necessary for the office to fulfill its commitments immediately. With this the existing office would have a hard time with performance issues since the Disciplinary Officer is only the one at work and serves liaison between other offices and divisions in other departments. The existing state of the office could then see negative impact on the Disciplinary Officer's productivity and loss of valuable time, with these current issues at hand it requires more time, effort, and resources to be as productive as other department in the offices within the institution.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

<p>The creative options and alternatives were considered to identify the most applicable method of using technology to improve the Disciplinary Office (DO) of Asia Pacific College (APC) business processes of documentation, storing, and updating each student records real time. In addition, this will serve as the approach in which allows this project to meet with the objectives of Data Quality and Timeliness, Productive and Efficient, and Employee Development. 

The recommended project will have to be transform from manual data and processes of the DO to a digitalized specialized Rams Violation Management System (RVMS) that documents all the information required by the office to carry out its tasks promptly, mainly focusing on the reporting process. Some of the following aims to achieve the projects overall results:
•	Users will be able to Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) forms and necessary information at any time from any location instead of manually retrieving and gathering repetitive data for the office’s processes. 
•	The system will be running on a real-time basis which allows users to immediately gain accessible and convenient record management.
•	Users will have the ability to be able to increase their level of dependability in which contributes to the organization’s overall efficiency

</p>

<h2>Justification</h2>

<p>The adaptation of Rams Violation Management System (RVMS) from the traditional mainframe system shifting to a system that comprises of three elements that will collaborate to serve and improve the efficiency and digitization of stakeholder processes. Additionally, the RVMS is consistent with the organization's strategy and objectives as it promotes the use of technology to enhance how they conduct business. While other options and the status quo were considered, the RVMS was chosen for proposal in this business case because it enables the quickest realization of benefits while also providing for the greatest efficiency and cost reduction. </p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>The proponents discovered the Discipline Office’s (DO) pain points by utilizing the Problem Pyramid tool. Due to the tedious processes and excessively manual methods used in the Discipline Office, productivity and efficiency are compromised. On the other hand, out-of-date student records add to the office's challenges by delaying a prospective appointment with the individual in question. According to the disciplinary officer's insights, he performs 100% of the duty alone, resulting in the specific job consuming so much of his time and decreasing office efficiency. These constraints and difficulties might have an adverse effect on the officer in charge and the quality and quantity of work accomplished. Thus, the proponents acknowledge that implementing a student management system focusing on the DO's reporting system is critical to developing a more digitalized, efficient, and sustainable method of keeping up with the DO's daily operations.</p>

<h2>Organizational Impact</h2>

<p>The Rams Violation Management System (RVMS) will impact Asia Pacific College in several ways.  The following provides a high-level explanation of how the organization, tools, processes, and roles and responsibilities will be affected because of the RVMS implementation:

•	Tools: the existing tools for reporting violations and narrative reports will be phased out during the RVMS implementation. This will require training on how to use the RVMS tools, or at the very least orientation on how to use RVMS to report violations and narrative reports, and an explanation of how RVMS complements existing organizational tools.
•	Processes: rather than requiring a lengthy and time-consuming communication process, the core design enables those teams to collaborate when necessary. This facilitates the efficient communication of messages, the more precise completion of specific tasks, and the advancement of the vision, mission, or goals established. The truly innovative part of the project lies in the integration of automated insights and analytics that will assist the Disciplinary Officer in determining what key parameters should always be kept in check such the following:
o	Violation Count of all students
o	Minor Offense Count
o	Major Offense Count
o	Most committed violations
The parameters listed above will be automatically shown to the Disciplinary Officer making it easier for him to monitor students who need to be carefully observed. This project will greatly improve the way the disciplinary office will operate and will greatly improve its processes.
•	Roles and Responsibilities: aside from reducing time-consuming and tedious processes and increasing office efficiency, the RVMS can also provide high-cost returns by freeing employees to perform more valuable tasks. This ensures that the organization's human resources are used efficiently, increasing overall productivity.
•	Hardware/Software: along with the software and licensing required for the project, the organization will need to purchase additional servers to support the platform and its anticipated growth over the succeeding years.
</p>

<h2>Technology Migration</h2>
<p>To effectively create RVMS, a phased approach has been developed which will result in minimal/no disruption to day-to-day operations, administration, and payroll activities.  The following is a high-level overview of the phased approach for the development which is under the Design phase in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):

Phase I: A prototype of the RVMS website will be created to easily visualize what the system will look like.
Phase II: A working web application will be developed with basic functionalities wherein all new features for RVMS will be added.
Phase III: A termly student record update will be implemented in the system which will enable the disciplinary officer to have an accurate record that they can utilize to accomplish their objectives faster and more efficiently.
Phase IV:  A digital narrative report centralized system will be added in the system which will enable the Disciplinary Officer to investigate the document quickly and store the details of each case within a database, which will improve his efficiency and help the disciplinary officer deal with any accreditation purposes.
Phase V: A new digital blue slip will be implemented for violators to speed up the process of exchanging slips from the guards to the disciplinary officer.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The scope management plan is a crucial component of the overall project management approach for the SurveiRams project. It outlines the tools and techniques that will be utilized to effectively document and control the scope of the project, ensuring that it remains within the defined boundaries and aligns with the project objectives. As an agile project, the scope management plan will be developed and executed in accordance with agile methodologies, which emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress.</p>
<p>The project team will work collaboratively with stakeholders, using agile techniques to prioritize and manage scope, identify and manage changes, and ensure that the project remains on track to deliver a successful SurveiRams system that meets the needs of all stakeholders.</p>
<p>Scope Definition:  The scope of SurveiRams ticketing system will be defined through the following activities:</p>

<p>1.	Project Charter: The project charter will provide a clear definition of the project's objectives, deliverables, stakeholders, and constraints, serving as a foundational document for scope management.</p>
<p>2.	Product Backlog: The product backlog, a key artifact in agile methodologies, will be utilized to capture and prioritize all the features, functionalities, and requirements of the SurveiRams system. It will serve as a dynamic document that evolves throughout the project, reflecting changing priorities and stakeholder needs.</p>
<p>3.	User Stories: User stories, a common practice in agile methodologies, will be used to further detail the requirements of the SurveiRams system in a user-centric manner. User stories will capture the "who," "what," and "why" of each requirement, supplying a clear understanding of the desired outcomes.</p>
<p>4.	Scope statement: The scope statement involves clearly defining the boundaries and extent of the project. The scope statement will outline the specific features, functionalities, and requirements of the ticketing system, as well as any exclusions or limitations that will provide a high-level overview of the project scope.</p>
<p>5.	Sprint Planning and Review Meetings: Sprint planning and review meetings, integral to agile methodologies, will be conducted to collaboratively define the scope of each sprint and review the completed work against the defined scope. This will ensure that the project team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the scope at each stage of the project.
</p>
<h2>Scope Management Approach</h2>
<p>Mr. Alexis Martin, the designated Project Manager, will work closely with Mr. Jojo Castillo, the project sponsor, and other key stakeholders to define and effectively manage the scope of the project, as well as oversee the fulfillment of all project requirements and ensure that the project deliverables are accepted and approved by the project sponsor and relevant stakeholders, with successful completion of the project dependent on the acceptance of all deliverables and resolution of any outstanding issues.</p>
<p>The scope of the SurveiRams project will be defined using various documents such as a Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, and a detailed Statement of Work (SOW), with regular reviews conducted throughout the project to ensure alignment with objectives and proper documentation of any changes. To measure and verify the scope, quality checklists will be developed, a scope baseline will be established, and work performance measurements will be used to track any progress. The Project Manager will submit a formal request for scope change, which the project sponsor will approve after evaluating it for alignment with the project goals, impacts on schedule and budget, and contribution to project success, ensuring only approved changes are made.</p>

<h2>Roles and Responsibilities </h2>
<p>The project manager, sponsor and the project team will play an important role in analyzation and documentation the scope of the project. As such, the project sponsor, manager and the team must be assigned to their respective roles and knows the responsibilities to ensure that the person assigned is performing the work better than the expected throughout the entire duration of the project.</p>

<h2> Scope Definition </h2>
<p>The scope definition process for the project "SurveiRams” was developed based on the requirements identified during the requirements definition process. The following documents were used as references: Requirements Documentation, Requirements Management Plan and a Requirements Traceability Matrix.</p>
<p>To define the project's scope, we used the following tools and techniques: feedback analysis, product analysis, and facilitated interviews. The team utilized adviser judgment to assess the feasibility of the project and identify potential risks. Product analysis was conducted to determine the features and functions required by the new system. Facilitated interviews were also conducted with stakeholders to gather their inputs and ensure their requirements were considered.</p>
<p>Based on the analysis and input gathered, the following deliverables were defined as part of the project scope:
SurveiRams should include the following features:</p>
<p><em> Ticketing Database </em></p>
<p><em> Performance Evaluation</em></p>
<p><em> Reporting and Analytics </em></p>
<p><em> User Training and Support </em></p>
<p>The scope definition process was tied back to the requirements definition process, ensuring that the project scope met all the identified requirements. Additionally, the Project Charter and Preliminary Project Scope Statement were also referred to during the scope definition process.</p>

</ul>
<h2> Work Breakdown Structure </h2>


<h2> Scope Verification </h2>
<p>
The project team will use various techniques for scope verification to guarantee that the SurveiRams System project deliverables satisfy the original scope. These methods include:
</p>
<p>
<b>Quality Checklists</b>
</p>
<p>
 The project team will use checklists that outline the essential requirements for each deliverable to be accepted. These checklists will be employed to ensure that each deliverable satisfies all necessary criteria before progressing.
</p>
<p>
<b>Work Performance Measurements</b>
</p>
<p>
 The team will use work performance measurements to monitor and gauge the advancement of each deliverable during the development phase. This approach will enable the team to detect any possible issues or deviations from the original scope and take prompt corrective measures.
</p>
<p>
<b>Scope Baseline</b>
</p>
<p>
The team will establish a scope baseline, which captures a snapshot of the initial project scope. Any modifications to the scope must be recorded and authorized before being implemented. The scope baseline will be employed to ensure that the final deliverables align with the original project scope.
</p>
<p>
<b>Formal Acceptance</b>
</p>
<p>
 Each deliverable will be formally accepted by the project sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders upon completion. This ensures that the project team meets the expectations of all relevant parties and allows any necessary feedback or changes to be made promptly.
</p>
<p>
Overall, it is critical that the project team maintains open communication and cooperation with the client and other stakeholders throughout the project to ensure that the deliverables meet the original scope and are formally approved.
</p>
</p>

<h2> Scope Control </h2>
<p>The Project adviser and the project team will discuss and identify on controlling the scope of the project. The project team will have based the statement of the work using WBS Dictionary and Product Backlogs for each Scope. The project team will guarantee that they execute the job based on the description of the WBS Dictionary and generate the defined deliverable for each WBS element. The project advisor will monitor the project team and their progression the project to provide guidance that the scope control process is followed and progress is reported through the Project Scope measurement tools.</p>

<h2> Scope Change </h2>
<p>The team will need to evaluate the impact of any change in project scope that is authorized by the project sponsor on the present timetable. When an issue arises in the project that requires a substantial revision of the project scope, a change proposal can be considered. The team should approach any modification carefully given that the outcome could have a favorable or negative impact on the project's advancement. Any team member may request modifications, but they must be submitted in the form of a project change request document to the project stakeholder. </p>


=Cost Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Cost Management Plan for the SurveiRams System project is to ensure that all project-related expenses are managed efficiently throughout its entire duration. The plan outlines the techniques and guidelines that will be employed to gauge, communicate, and regulate project expenses.</p>
<p>Cost management responsibilities:</p>
<p>The Project Manager will be responsible for managing the project's expenses and act as the contact for any cost-related concerns. The Project Leader, on the other hand, will be responsible for supervising project spending and making sure that it stays within the authorized budget.</p>

<p>Cost change approval:</p>
<p>Authorization from the Project Manager is required prior to implementing any changes in cost. In case the cost modification exceeds 10% of the total project budget, approval from the Project Sponsor must be obtained before executing it.</p>

<p>Cost measurement and reporting:</p>
<p>The project expenses will be evaluated and recorded on a monthly basis, using both the cost performance index (CPI) and the schedule performance index (SPI). Monthly expense reports will be submitted to the Project Sponsor.</p>

<p>Budget format and standards:</p>
<p>The budget will be presented in a simplified and concise format by utilizing a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel. The budget will be divided into distinct line items, with each item having a detailed cost estimate. It will be updated once there are any changes, and any changes made will be indicated. </p>

<p>Overall, the objective of the Cost Management Plan for the SurveiRams System project is to ensure that all project-related expenses are effectively monitored and controlled, allowing the project to be completed within the assigned budget. This approach will ensure the project's successful and timely completion.</p>

<h2>Cost Management Approach</h2>
<p>The cost management approach for SurveiRams will be based on the following principles:</p>

<li>Clear definition of costs</li>
<p>The project team will define all the costs associated with SurveiRams. Hardware and software costs, development costs, maintenance costs, testing and quality assurance costs, and any other expenses related to the project.</p>

<li>Budget development and tracking</li>
<p>An effective budget tracking system will be implemented to regularly monitor actual spending against the allocated budget and identify areas for improvement.</p>

<li>Cost estimates</li>
<p>The project team will utilize diverse methods of cost estimation to guarantee that the allocated budget is precise and feasible.</p>

<li>Cost variance analysis</li>
<p>The project team will analyze and distinguish between the actual cost in the budget and predicted cost estimates to pinpoint reasons for any discrepancies, then initiate remedial measures to align expenses accordingly.</p>

<li>Cost management roles and responsibilities</li>
<p>The project team members will define and establish clear roles and responsibilities for cost management.</p>

<li>Approval process for changes</li>
<p>Changes to projects or budgets will be approved formally through an established and implemented procedure.</p>

<li>Reporting and communication</li>
<p>Regular cost reports will be provided and distributed to the project team, project sponsor, and management to inform every one of the project's financial situations.</p>
<p>By implementing a clear cost management approach in SurveiRams, the project team can help ensure that the project stays on budget and meets financial objectives. This can help to minimize the risk of cost overruns and ensure that the project is completed successfully.</p>

<h2>Measuring Project Costs</h2>
<p>            This section defines how the project’s costs will be measured.  The PMBOK focuses on Earned Value Management for measuring and controlling a project’s costs.  Earned Value Management is a broad and powerful tool; as such, we recommend that all project managers take some formal courses in Earned Value Management.

In this section you should detail how you will measure the project costs.  What Earned Value measurements will be captured and reported upon.  Will you use any tools, such as project management software, to assist in capturing Earned Value metrics?  How will you forecast future project costs?  Will you review cost performance over time, across work packages or schedule activities?

Our example in this section measures four Earned Value measurements; Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Variance (CV), Schedule Performance Index (SPI) and Cost Performance Index (CPI).  For most typical projects these four measurements can provide enough insight for effective management without overburdening the Project Manager with Earned Value calculations and measurements.

Schedule Variance (SV) is a measurement of the schedule performance for a project.  It’s calculated by taking the Earned Value (EV) and subtracting the Planned Value (PV).  Since EV is the actual value earned in the project and the PV is the value our project plan says we should have earned at this point, when we subtract what we planned from the actual we have a good measurement which tells us if we are ahead or behind the baseline schedule according to our project plan.  If SV is zero, then the project is perfectly on schedule.  If SV is greater than zero, the project is earning more value than planned thus it’s ahead of schedule.  If SV is less than zero, the project is earning less value than planned thus it’s behind schedule.

Cost Variance (CV) is a measurement of the budget performance for a project.  CV is calculated by subtracting Actual Costs (AC) from Earned Value (EV).  As we already know, EV is the actual value earned in the project.  AC is the actual costs incurred to date, thus when we subtract what our actual costs from the EV we have a good measurement which tells us if we are above or below budget.  If CV is zero, then the project is perfectly on budget.  If CV is greater than zero, the project is earning more value than planned thus it’s under budget.  If CV is less than zero, the project is earning less value than planned thus it’s over budget.

The Schedule Performance Index (SPI) measures the progress achieved against that which was planned.  SPI is calculated as EV/PV.  If EV is equal to PV the value of the SPI is 1.  If EV is less than the PV then the value is less than 1, which means the project is behind schedule.  If EV is greater than the PV the value of the SPI is greater than one, which means the project is ahead of schedule.  A well performing project should have its SPI as close to 1 as possible, or maybe even a little under 1.

Cost Performance Index (CPI) measures the value of the work completed compared to the actual cost of the work completed.  CPI is calculated as EV/AC. If CPI is equal to 1 the project is perfectly on budget.  If the CPI is greater than 1 the project is under budget, if it’s less than 1 the project is over budget.
</p>

<h2>Reporting Format</h2>
<p>Reporting for cost management will be included in the monthly project status report.  The Monthly Project Status Report will include a section labeled, “Cost Management”.  This section will contain the Earned Value Metrics identified in the previous section.  All cost variances outside of the thresholds identified in this Cost Management Plan will be reported on including any corrective actions which are planned.  Change Requests which are triggered based upon project cost overruns will be identified and tracked in this report. </p>

<h2>Cost Variance Response Process</h2>
<p>The Control Thresholds for this project is a CPI or SPI of 1, as stated above in the Measuring Project Cost.

If the Project Sponsor selects a corrective action option,  
The corrective actions may include:
</p>
<li>Reducing the scope of the project </li>
<li>Reducing the quality of the project deliverables </li>
<li>Increasing the budget for the project </li>
<li>Increasing productivity or efficiency of project team members </li>
<p> The Project Manager will monitor the implementation of the corrective actions and provide regular updates to the Project Sponsor on the status of the project budget.
If the project continues to exceed the Control Thresholds, the Project Manager will forward the issue to their Project Adviser for further action.
</p>

<h2>Cost Change Control Process</h2>
<p> The cost change control process will include the following steps: </p>

<li>Identification of Cost Change</li>
<p>The Project Manager or any team member who identifies and proposes a potential cost change must document and bring it to the attention of the Project Sponsor through a cost change request form.</p>

<li>Analysis of the Cost Change</li>
<p>The project team will analyze the cost change to determine its impact on the project schedule, budget, and overall performance. </p>

<li>Approval of the Cost Change</li>
<p>The Project Manager will present the analysis of the cost change to the Project Sponsor and other relevant stakeholders. The Project Sponsor will then approve or reject the cost change based on the analysis provided.</p>

<li>Implementation of the Cost Change</li>
<p>Once the cost change is approved, the Project Manager will update the project cost baseline and implement the necessary cost changes to the project plan in accordance with the project schedule and budget.</p>

<li>Tracking and Monitoring of the Cost Change</li>
<p>The Project Manager will track and monitor the cost change to ensure that it is implemented effectively and efficiently. The project team will regularly review the progress of the cost change and make adjustments as necessary.</p>

<li>Reporting on Cost Change</li>
<p>The Project Manager will report on the cost change to the Project Sponsor and other stakeholders. The report will detail the factors contributing to the cost change, its implications for the project timeline, budget, and quality of work, as well as the progress achieved in managing the situation.</p>

<p>The cost change control process is a crucial aspect of managing the SurveiRams ticketing system project's financial aspects. By analyzing and approving cost changes, the project can ensure that it remains within the allocated budget and avoids any unexpected financial challenges. Regular reporting on cost changes will allow the project manager to keep the project sponsor and other key stakeholders informed of any financial updates and ensure transparency throughout the project's lifecycle. By adhering to this cost change control process, the SurveiRams ticketing system project can achieve its objectives and deliver quality results within the specified budget.
</p>


=Schedule Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Managing a project’s schedule is one of the most important things to do. Discussed in this document are Schedule Management Approach, Schedule Control, Schedule Changes and Thresholds, and Scope Change. These must be elaborated as schedules are not always set in stone. There are unforeseen risks that might occur that could offset a project’s schedule.</p>

<h2>Schedule Management Approach</h2>
<p> Once a preliminary schedule has been produced, the project team will regularly review and update the schedule to ensure that the project stays on track. In addition to the project schedule, Earned Value Measures will be used to monitor and compare budgeted or scheduled progress against actual progress.</p>

<li>- The team will also utilize project management software to facilitate task tracking and ensure that deadlines are met. </li>

<li>- The project manager will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the project against the schedule, identifying potential delays, and taking corrective action where necessary.  </li>

<li>- The team will also hold regular status meetings to discuss progress and identify any issues that need to be addressed.  </li>

<li>- The project manager will provide regular status reports to stakeholders, including the project sponsor, to keep them informed of the project's progress.  </li>

 
<h2>Schedule Control</h2>
<p>  Frequency of Updates and Reviews:</p>
<li> The project schedule will be updated on a weekly basis by the project manager. </li> 
<li> A schedule review meeting will be held every week to review the progress of the project against the schedule. </li> 
<li> Any changes to the schedule will be communicated to the project team and stakeholders within 24 hours of being made. </li> 

<p>Roles and Responsibilities</p>
<li> The project manager is responsible for maintaining and updating the project schedule, as well as communicating any changes to the team and stakeholders. </li> 
<li> The project team is responsible for providing accurate and timely information to the project manager to help ensure the schedule is up-to-date and on track. </li> 
<li> Stakeholders are responsible for reviewing the project schedule and providing feedback or concerns to the project manager in a timely manner. </li> 

<p> Communicating Schedule and Progress: </p>
<li> The project manager will communicate the project schedule and progress to the project team and stakeholders on a regular basis. </li> 
<li> Progress reports will be provided weekly to stakeholders, highlighting any major accomplishments or issues that may impact the project schedule. </li> 
<li> The project manager will also provide a monthly schedule status report to stakeholders, which will include an updated schedule and any changes made during the month. </li> 
<p>In conclusion, effective schedule control is critical to the success of the SurveiRams project. By establishing clear roles and responsibilities and maintaining open communication with the project team and stakeholders, the project manager can ensure that the project stays on schedule and within budget.</p>

<h2>Schedule Changes and Thresholds</h2>
<p> Schedule changes and thresholds are critical elements of project management. It is essential to have a defined process in place to ensure that any schedule changes are well-documented and approved by the appropriate project stakeholders. Before making any changes to the schedule, the project team must complete the "Schedule Change" form. This form must include the proposed changes, justification for the changes, and the potential impact on the project's timeline, budget, and resources. The project sponsor must approve the schedule change request, and the updated schedule must be communicated to all relevant stakeholders. By following this process, the project team can ensure that all schedule changes are transparent, well-documented, and aligned with the project's goals and objectives.</p>
<p> The project manager is responsible for submitting a "Schedule Change" form to the project sponsor for approval before making any changes to the project schedule. Once approved, the project manager will update the schedule and communicate the changes and their impact to the project team and stakeholders. All change requests will be archived in the project records repository.
</p>

<h2>Scope Change</h2>
<p> The team will need to evaluate the impact of any change in project scope that is authorized by the project sponsor on the present timetable. When an issue arises in the project that requires a substantial revision of the project scope, a change proposal can be considered. The team should approach any modification carefully given that the outcome could have a favorable or negative impact on the project's advancement. Any team member may request modifications, but they must be submitted in the form of a project change request document to the project stakeholder.</p>


=Work Breakdown Structure=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) has been developed to help clarify the project's goals and scope. The project is divided into smaller, more manageable components called work packages by the WBS, each of which represents a specific task that must be completed to achieve the project's overall objectives. The WBS acts as a hierarchical structure that aids in establishing a project schedule, budget, and resource plan as well as assisting the project team in understanding the relationships between various work packages. It is an essential tool for managing and controlling the SurveiRams System project because it also aids in tracking progress and spotting potential risks and problems.</p>
