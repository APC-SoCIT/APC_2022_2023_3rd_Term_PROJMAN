*More sustainable and cost-effective: By digitizing the current system, the project can eliminate the need for excessive paperwork, making the entire process more sustainable and cost-effective in the long run. 

''' COST '''

*Cost Savings: SurveiRams reduces the use of paper. This also results in cost savings and increased productivity. Paperless documentation increases the efficiency of data transmission by reducing paperwork and physical contact like couriers and printers. 

*Cloud Cost: According to Amazon AWS Pricing in the Asia Pacific region, their cloud storage will cost $0.025 (PHP 1.38) per GB for the first 50 TB and will cost $0.024 (PHP 1.33) per GB on the next 450 TB. This will be cheaper than physical storage in the long run. 

==4.7 Alternatives Analysis==

*Status Quo – One alternative to this project is keeping the current system. This means that no changes in personnel or materials will occur. Sticking to the status quo was rejected as an option, as this system proved to be tedious and time-consuming. 
*Modification of Current System – Another alternative for SurveiRams is simply adding some minor changes to their current system, but will not be digitized. An example of this is removing the logbook from the process and having the guards directly log their reports on an Incident Report form. This is also not a viable option because it is still going to be time-consuming. The forms will still be then digitized by the concerned office.

==7.4 Scope Definition==

The scope definition process for the project "SurveiRams” was developed based on the requirements identified during the requirements definition process. The following documents were used as references: Requirements Documentation, Requirements Management Plan and a Requirements Traceability Matrix. 

To define the project's scope, we used the following tools and techniques: feedback analysis, product analysis, and facilitated interviews. The team utilized adviser judgment to assess the feasibility of the project and identify potential risks. Product analysis was conducted to determine the features and functions required by the new system. Facilitated interviews were also conducted with stakeholders to gather their inputs and ensure their requirements were considered. 

Based on the analysis and input gathered, the following deliverables were defined as part of the project scope: 
SurveiRams should include the following features: 

*Ticketing database 

*Performance evaluation 

*Reporting and analytics 

*User training and support 

The scope definition process was tied back to the requirements definition process, ensuring that the project scope met all the identified requirements. Additionally, the Project Charter and Preliminary Project Scope Statement were also referred to during the scope definition process.

==7.6 Work Breakdown Structure==

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Work Breakdown Structure Dictionary are key elements to effective scope management.  This section should discuss how the project scope is to be subdivided into smaller deliverables in the WBS and WBS Dictionary and how these smaller components are managed during the life of the project.   

<img src="https://github.com/apcjlquesada/APC_2022_2023_T3_PROJMAN_MI202_G03_KAYVI_byte/blob/main/wiki_images/WBS.png" alt="WBS" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;">

==7.7 Scope Verification ==

The project team will use various techniques for scope verification to guarantee that the SurveiRams System project deliverables satisfy the original scope. These methods include: 

===7.7.1 Quality Checklists===

The project team will use checklists that outline the essential requirements for each deliverable to be accepted. These checklists will be employed to ensure that each deliverable satisfies all necessary criteria before progressing. 

===7.7.2 Work Performance Measurements===

The team will use work performance measurements to monitor and gauge the advancement of each deliverable during the development phase. This approach will enable the team to detect any possible issues or deviations from the original scope and take prompt corrective measures. 

===7.7.3 Scope Baseline===

The team will establish a scope baseline, which captures a snapshot of the initial project scope. Any modifications to the scope must be recorded and authorized before being implemented. The scope baseline will be employed to ensure that the final deliverables align with the original project scope. 

===7.7.4 Formal Acceptance===

Each deliverable will be formally accepted by the project sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders upon completion. This ensures that the project team meets the expectations of all relevant parties and allows any necessary feedback or changes to be made promptly. 

Overall, it is critical that the project team maintains open communication and cooperation with the client and other stakeholders throughout the project to ensure that the deliverables meet the original scope and are formally approved. 

==7.8 Scope Control==
The change management plan must be consulted in the event of the desire to change the project scope. The procedures written there will be followed. The change’s impact on the schedule and budget will be factored into making the decision. Should any changes happen, all project documents related will be updated. 

=8. COST MANAGEMENT PLAN=

==8.1 Introduction==

The purpose of the Cost Management Plan for the SurveiRams System project is to ensure that all project-related expenses are managed efficiently throughout its entire duration. The plan outlines the techniques and guidelines that will be employed to gauge, communicate, and regulate project expenses. 

# '''Cost management responsibilities''' <br> - The Project Manager will be responsible for managing the project's expenses and act as the contact for any cost-related concerns. The Project Leader, on the other hand, will be responsible for supervising project spendings and making sure that it stays within the authorized budget. 

# '''Cost change approval''' <br> - Authorization from the Project Manager is required prior to implementing any changes in cost. In case the cost modification exceeds 10% of the total project budget, approval from the Project Sponsor must be obtained before executing it. 

# '''Cost measurement and reporting''' <br> - The budget will be presented in a simplified and concise format by utilizing a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel. The budget will be divided into distinct line items, with each item having a detailed cost estimate. It will be updated once there are any changes, and any changes made will be indicated.  

Overall, the objective of the Cost Management Plan for the SurveiRams System project is to ensure that all project-related expenses are effectively monitored and controlled, allowing the project to be completed within the assigned budget. This approach will ensure the project's successful and timely completion. 


==8.2 Cost Management Approach==
The cost management approach for SurveiRams will be based on the following principles: 

# '''Clear definition of cost'''  <br> - The project team will define all the costs associated with SurveiRams. Hardware and software costs, development costs,  and manpower costs, and any other expenses related to the project. 

# '''Budget development and tracking''' <br> - An effective budget tracking system will be implemented to regularly monitor actual spending against the allocated budget and identify areas for improvement. 

# '''Cost estimates''' <br> - The project team will utilize diverse methods of cost estimation to guarantee that the allocated budget is precise and feasible. 

# '''Cost variance analysis''' <br> - The project team will analyze and distinguish between the actual cost in the budget and predicted cost estimates to pinpoint reasons for any discrepancies, then initiate remedial measures to align expenses accordingly. 

# '''Cost management roles and responsibilities''' <br> - The project team members will define and establish clear roles and responsibilities for cost management. 

# '''Approval process for changes'''  <br> - Changes to projects or budgets will be approved formally through an established and implemented procedure. 

# '''Reporting and communication'''  <br> - Regular cost reports will be provided and distributed to the project team, project sponsor, and management to inform every one of the project's financial situations. 

By implementing a clear cost management approach in SurveiRams, the project team can help ensure that the project stays on budget and meets financial objectives. This can help to minimize the risk of cost overruns and ensure that the project is completed successfully. 


==8.3 Measuring Project Costs==

This section defines how the project’s costs will be measured.  The PMBOK focuses on Earned Value Management for measuring and controlling a project’s costs.  Earned Value Management is a broad and powerful tool; as such, we recommend that all project managers take some formal courses in Earned Value Management.

In this section you should detail how you will measure the project costs. What Earned Value measurements will be captured and reported upon. Will you use any tools, such as project management software, to assist in capturing Earned Value metrics? How will you forecast future project costs? Will you review cost performance over time, across work packages or schedule activities?

Our example in this section measures four Earned Value measurements; Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Variance (CV), Schedule Performance Index (SPI) and Cost Performance Index (CPI). For most typical projects these four measurements can provide enough insight for effective management without overburdening the Project Manager with Earned Value calculations and measurements.

Schedule Variance (SV) is a measurement of the schedule performance for a project. It’s calculated by taking the Earned Value (EV) and subtracting the Planned Value (PV). Since EV is the actual value earned in the project and the PV is the value our project plan says we should have earned at this point, when we subtract what we planned from the actual we have a good measurement which tells us if we are ahead or behind the baseline schedule according to our project plan. If SV is zero, then the project is perfectly on schedule. If SV is greater than zero, the project is earning more value than planned thus it’s ahead of schedule. If SV is less than zero, the project is earning less value than planned thus it’s behind schedule.

Cost Variance (CV) is a measurement of the budget performance for a project. CV is calculated by subtracting Actual Costs (AC) from Earned Value (EV). As we already know, EV is the actual value earned in the project. AC is the actual costs incurred to date, thus when we subtract what our actual costs from the EV we have a good measurement which tells us if we are above or below budget. If CV is zero, then the project is perfectly on budget. If CV is greater than zero, the project is earning more value than planned thus it’s under budget. If CV is less than zero, the project is earning less value than planned thus it’s over budget.

The Schedule Performance Index (SPI) measures the progress achieved against that which was planned. SPI is calculated as EV/PV. If EV is equal to PV the value of the SPI is 1. If EV is less than the PV then the value is less than 1, which means the project is behind schedule. If EV is greater than the PV the value of the SPI is greater than one, which means the project is ahead of schedule. A well performing project should have its SPI as close to 1 as possible, or maybe even a little under 1.

Cost Performance Index (CPI) measures the value of the work completed compared to the actual cost of the work completed. CPI is calculated as EV/AC. If CPI is equal to 1 the project is perfectly on budget. If the CPI is greater than 1 the project is under budget, if it’s less than 1 the project is over budget.


==8.4 Reporting Format==

Reporting on cost management will be included in the monthly project status report.  The Monthly Project Status Report will include a section labeled, “Cost Management”.  This section will contain the Earned Value Metrics identified in the previous section.  All cost variances outside of the thresholds identified in this Cost Management plan will be reported on including any corrective actions which are planned.  Change Requests which are triggered based upon project cost overruns will be identified and tracked in this report. 

==8.5 Cost Variance Response Process==

The Control Thresholds for this project is a CPI or SPI of 1, as stated above in the Measuring Project Cost. 

If the Project Sponsor selects a corrective action option,   
The corrective actions may include: 

* Reducing the scope of the project 
* Reducing the quality of the project deliverables 
* Increasing the budget for the project 
* Increasing productivity or efficiency of project team members 

==8.6 Cost Change Control Process==

The cost change control process will include the following steps: 

# '''Identification of Cost Change''' <br> - The Project Manager or any team member who identifies and proposes a potential cost change must document and bring it to the attention of the Project Sponsor through a cost change request form. 

# '''Analysis of the Cost Change''' <br> - The project team will analyze the cost change to determine its impact on the project schedule, budget, and overall performance.  

# '''Approval of the Cost Change'''  <br> - The Project Manager will present an analysis of the cost change to the Project Sponsor and other relevant stakeholders. The Project Sponsor will then approve or reject the cost change based on the analysis provided. 

# '''Implementation of the Cost Change'''  <br> - Once the cost change is approved, the Project Manager will update the project cost baseline and implement the necessary cost changes to the project plan in accordance with the project schedule and budget. 

# '''Tracking and Monitoring of the Cost Change'''  <br> - The Project Manager will track and monitor the cost change to ensure that it is implemented effectively and efficiently. The project team will regularly review the progress of the cost change and adjust as necessary. 

# '''Reporting on the Cost Change''' <br> - The Project Manager will report on the cost change to the Project Sponsor and other stakeholders. The report will detail the factors contributing to the cost change, its implications for the project timeline, budget, and quality of work, as well as the progress achieved in managing the situation. 

The cost change control process is a crucial aspect of managing the SurveiRams ticketing system project's financial aspects. By analyzing and approving cost changes, the project can ensure that it remains within the allocated budget and avoids any unexpected financial challenges. Regular reporting on cost changes will allow the project manager to keep the project sponsor and other key stakeholders informed of any financial updates and ensure transparency throughout the project's lifecycle. By adhering to this cost change control process, the SurveiRams ticketing system project can achieve its objectives and deliver quality results within the specified budget. 


==8.7 Project Budget==


=9. SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLAN=

==9.1 Introduction==

Managing a project’s schedule is one of the most important things to do. Discussed in this document are Schedule Management Approach, Schedule Control, Schedule Changes and Thresholds, and Scope Change. These must be elaborated as schedules are not always set in stone. There are unforeseen risks that might occur that could offset a project’s schedule.

==9.2 Schedule Management Approach==
Once a preliminary schedule has been produced, the project team will regularly review and update the schedule to ensure that the project stays on track. In addition to the project schedule, Earned Value Measures will be used to monitor and compare budgeted or scheduled progress against actual progress. 

Any changes to the schedule will be communicated to all stakeholders in a timely manner. Regular monitoring and tracking of the project will be done to ensure adherence to the schedule. 

* The team will also utilize project management software to facilitate task tracking and ensure that deadlines are met.  
* The project manager will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the project against the schedule, identifying potential delays, and taking corrective action where necessary.  
* The team will also hold regular status meetings to discuss progress and identify any issues that need to be addressed.  
* The project manager will provide regular status reports to stakeholders, including the project sponsor, to keep them informed of the project's progress. 

==9.3 Schedule Control==
;Frequency of Updates and Reviews: 

:The project schedule will be updated on a weekly basis by the project manager. 
:A schedule review meeting will be held every week to review the progress of the project against the schedule. 
:Any changes to the schedule will be communicated to the project team and stakeholders within 48 hours of being made. 

;Roles and Responsibilities: 

:The project manager is responsible for maintaining and updating the project schedule, as well as communicating any changes to the team and stakeholders. 
:To ensure optimal project management and successful project delivery, the project team must finish all the required deliverables on time. 
:The project team is responsible for providing accurate and timely information to the project manager to help ensure the schedule is up-to-date and on track. 
:Stakeholders are responsible for reviewing the project schedule and providing feedback or concerns to the project manager in a timely manner. 

;Communicating Schedule and Progress: 

:The project manager will communicate the project schedule and progress to the project team and stakeholders on a regular basis. 
:Progress reports will be provided weekly to stakeholders, highlighting any major accomplishments or issues that may impact the project schedule. 
:The project manager will also provide a monthly schedule status report to stakeholders, which will include an updated schedule and any changes made during the month. 

In conclusion, effective schedule control is critical to the success of the SurveiRams project. By establishing clear roles and responsibilities and maintaining open communication with the project team and stakeholders, the project manager can ensure that the project stays on schedule and within budget. 

==9.4 Schedule Changes and Thresholds==

Schedule changes and thresholds are critical elements of project management. It is essential to have a defined process in place to ensure that any schedule changes are well-documented and approved by the appropriate project stakeholders. Before making any changes to the schedule, the project team must complete the "Schedule Change" form. This form must include the proposed changes, justification for the changes, and the potential impact on the project's timeline, budget, and resources. The project sponsor must approve the schedule change request, and the updated schedule must be communicated to all relevant stakeholders. By following this process, the project team can ensure that all schedule changes are transparent, well-documented, and aligned with the project's goals and objectives. 
 
The project manager is responsible for submitting a "Schedule Change" form to the project sponsor for approval before making any changes to the project schedule. Once approved, the project manager will update the schedule and communicate the changes and their impact to the project team and stakeholders. All change requests will be archived in the project records repository. 

==9.5 Scope Change==
The team will need to evaluate the impact of any change in project scope that is authorized by the project sponsor on the present timetable. When an issue arises in a project that requires a substantial revision of the project scope, a change proposal can be considered. The team should approach any modification carefully given that the outcome could have a favorable or negative impact on the project's advancement. Any team member may request modifications, but they must be submitted in the form of a project change request document to the project stakeholder. 

=10. WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE=

==10.1 Introduction==

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) has been developed to help clarify the project's goals and scope. The project is divided into smaller, more manageable components called work packages by the WBS, each of which represents a specific task that must be completed to achieve the project's overall objectives. The WBS acts as a hierarchical structure that aids in establishing a project schedule, budget, and resource plan as well as assisting the project team in understanding the relationships between various work packages. It is an essential tool for managing and controlling the SurveiRams System project because it also aids in tracking progress and spotting potential risks and problems.
