==4.3.1 Problem Definition==

===4.3.1 Problem Statement===

The process of handwritten reports can be tedious and time-consuming, leading to inefficiency and errors in the documentation process. This can result in a lack of clarity and accessibility to important information for stakeholders such as managers and other employees who require accurate data in a timely manner.The current system also has unnecessary steps that could be eliminated when digitized such as rewriting the information from the logbook onto an incident report to be submitted to the Information Technology Resource Office (ITRO) or Building Maintenance Office (BMO).

===4.3.2 Organizational Impact===

SurveiRams facilitate the digitization of work processes by reducing the use of paper among employees. Security personnel quickly report incidents they encounter, which allows for a faster response time and enhances overall safety measures within the organization.BMO and ITRO faculty members will also receive the incident reports as soon as a guard logs it, instead of waiting for the rewritten version.

===4.3.3 Technology Migration===

In order to address the issues brought on by the manual administration of security personnel, BMO, and ITRO, the team developed a mobile application called SurveiRams that automates the manual documentation procedure. The migration from manual administration to SurveiRams will improve the overall efficiency and accuracy of the security personnel reporting process.

*Improved efficiency and productivity: The implementation of a digitalized system can optimize reviewing system reports by reducing paper documents, which can result in more efficient and effective work by allowing employees to focus more on higher value tasks. 

*Enhanced accuracy: The automated system can help reduce human error, providing a more accurate method of determining whether the security personnel have completed their assigned tasks. 

*Better decision-making: The application can provide analytical insights that can help the stakeholders interpret data reports and patterns, making decision-making more informed and strategic. 

*Increased security: The SurveiRams can help ensure building security by identifying anomalies or incident reports, aiding in monitoring and preventing future security breaches. 

*More sustainable and cost-effective: By digitizing the current system, the project can eliminate the need for excessive paperwork, making the entire process more sustainable and cost-effective in the long run. 

''' COST '''

*Cost Savings: SurveiRams reduces the use of paper. This also results in cost savings and increased productivity. Paperless documentation increases the efficiency of data transmission by reducing paperwork and physical contact like couriers and printers. 

==4.7 Alternatives Analysis==

*Status Quo – One alternative to this project is keeping the current system. This means that no changes in personnel or materials will occur. Sticking to the status quo was rejected as an option, as this system proved to be tedious and time-consuming. 
*Modification of Current System – Another alternative for SurveiRams is simply adding some minor changes to their current system, but will not be digitized. An example of this is removing the logbook from the process and having the guards directly log their reports on an Incident Report form. This is also not a viable option because it is still going to be time-consuming. The forms will still be then digitized by the concerned office.

=7. SCOPE MANAGEMENT PLAN=

==7.1 Introduction==

The scope management plan is a crucial component of the overall project management approach for the SurveiRams project. It outlines the tools and techniques that will be utilized to effectively document and control the scope of the project, ensuring that it remains within the defined boundaries and aligns with the project objectives. As an agile project, the scope management plan will be developed and executed in accordance with agile methodologies, which emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress.

The project team will work collaboratively with stakeholders, using agile techniques to prioritize and manage scope, identify and manage changes, and ensure that the project remains on track to deliver a successful SurveiRams system that meets the needs of all stakeholders.

==7.2 Scope Management Approach==

* Mr. Ian Onrubia, the designated Project Manager, will work closely with Mr. Jojo Castillo, the project sponsor, and other key stakeholders to define and effectively manage the scope of the project, as well as oversee the fulfillment of all project requirements and ensure that the project deliverables are accepted and approved by the project sponsor and relevant stakeholders, with successful completion of the project dependent on the acceptance of all deliverables and resolution of any outstanding issues. 

* The scope of the SurveiRams project will be defined using various documents such as a Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, and a detailed Statement of Work (SOW), with regular reviews conducted throughout the project to ensure alignment with objectives and proper documentation of any changes. To measure and verify the scope, quality checklists will be developed, a scope baseline will be established, and work performance measurements will be used to track any progress. The Project Manager will submit a formal request for scope change, which the project sponsor will approve after evaluating it for alignment with the project goals, impacts on schedule and budget, and contribution to project success, ensuring only approved changes are made. 

==7.3 Roles and Responsibilities==

The following are the roles and responsibilities in managing the project's scope:

==7.4 Scope Definition==

To define the project's scope, the project team conducted meetings to draft a list. The team then utilized adviser and consultant judgment to assess the feasibility of the project and identify potential risks. Product analysis was conducted to determine the features and functions required by the new system. Facilitated interviews were also conducted with stakeholders to gather their input and ensure their requirements were considered. The scope definition process was tied back to the Project Charter and preliminary Project Scope Statement were also referred to during the scope definition process. 

The scope of SurveiRams ticketing system will be defined through the following activities: 

;Project Charter: 
:The project charter will provide a clear definition of the project's objectives, deliverables, stakeholders, and constraints, serving as a foundational document for scope management. 

;Scope statement:
:The scope statement involves clearly defining the boundaries and extent of the project. The scope statement will outline the specific features, functionalities, and requirements of the ticketing system, as well as any exclusions or limitations that will provide a high-level overview of the project scope. 

;Sprint Planning and Review Meetings: 
:Sprint planning and review meetings will be conducted to collaboratively define the scope of each sprint and review the completed work against the defined scope. This will ensure that the project team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the scope at each stage of the project. 

;Product Backlog: 
:The product backlog will be created in the development phase, then utilized to capture and prioritize all the features, functionalities, and requirements of the SurveiRams system. It will serve as a dynamic document that evolves throughout the project, reflecting changing priorities and stakeholder needs. 

;User Stories: 
:User stories will be done in the next phase of the project to be used to further detail the requirements of the SurveiRams system in a user-centric manner. User stories will capture the "who," "what," and "why" of each requirement, supplying a clear understanding of the desired outcomes.

This section should discuss how the project scope is to be subdivided into smaller deliverables in the WBS and WBS Dictionary and how these smaller components are managed during the life of the project.   

<img src="https://github.com/apcjlquesada/APC_2022_2023_3rd_Term_PROJMAN/assets/97135850/fd3c4daa-80ba-461d-a44d-46186f024dec" alt="WBS" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;">

==7.7 Scope Verification ==

The project team will use various techniques for scope verification to guarantee that the SurveiRams System project deliverables satisfy the original scope. These methods include: 

===7.7.1 Quality Checklists===

The project team will use checklists that outline the essential requirements for each deliverable to be accepted. These checklists will be employed to ensure that each deliverable satisfies all necessary criteria before progressing. 

===7.7.2 Work Performance Measurements===

The team will use work performance measurements to monitor and gauge the advancement of each deliverable during the development phase. This approach will enable the team to detect any possible issues or deviations from the original scope and take prompt corrective measures. 

===7.7.3 Scope Baseline===

The team will establish a scope baseline, which captures a snapshot of the initial project scope. Any modifications to the scope must be recorded and authorized before being implemented. The scope baseline will be employed to ensure that the final deliverables align with the original project scope. 

===7.7.4 Formal Acceptance===

Each deliverable will be formally accepted by the project sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders upon completion. This ensures that the project team meets the expectations of all relevant parties and allows any necessary feedback or changes to be made promptly. 

Overall, it is critical that the project team maintains open communication and cooperation with the client and other stakeholders throughout the project to ensure that the deliverables meet the original scope and are formally approved. 

==7.8 Scope Control==
The change management plan must be consulted in the event of the desire to change the project scope. The procedures written there will be followed. The change’s impact on the schedule and budget will be factored into making the decision. Should any changes happen, all project documents related will be updated. 

=8. COST MANAGEMENT PLAN=

==8.1 Introduction==

The purpose of the Cost Management Plan for the SurveiRams System project is to ensure that all project-related expenses are managed efficiently throughout its entire duration. The plan outlines the techniques and guidelines that will be employed to gauge, communicate, and regulate project expenses. 

# '''Cost management responsibilities''' <br> - The Project Manager will be responsible for managing the project's expenses and act as the contact for any cost-related concerns. The Project Leader, on the other hand, will be responsible for supervising project spendings and making sure that it stays within the authorized budget.

# '''Cost change approval''' <br> - Authorization from the Project Manager is required prior to implementing any changes in cost. In case the cost modification exceeds 10% of the total project budget, approval from the Project Sponsor must be obtained before executing it.

# '''Cost measurement and reporting''' <br> - The project expenses will be evaluated and recorded on a monthly basis, using both the cost performance index (CPI) and the schedule performance index (SPI). Monthly expense reports will be submitted to the Project Sponsor.

# '''Budget format and standards''' <br> - The budget will be presented in a simplified and concise format by utilizing a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel. The budget will be divided into distinct line items, with each item having a detailed cost estimate. It will be updated once there are any changes, and any changes made will be indicated.   

Overall, the objective of the Cost Management Plan for the SurveiRams System project is to ensure that all project-related expenses are effectively monitored and controlled, allowing the project to be completed within the assigned budget. This approach will ensure the project's successful and timely completion.


==8.2 Cost Management Approach==
The cost management approach for SurveiRams will be based on the following principles: 

# '''Clear definition of cost'''  <br> - The project team will define all the costs associated with SurveiRams. Hardware and software costs, development costs,  and manpower costs, and any other expenses related to the project. 

# '''Budget development and tracking''' <br> - An effective budget tracking system will be implemented to regularly monitor actual spending against the allocated budget and identify areas for improvement. 

# '''Cost estimates''' <br> - The project team will utilize diverse methods of cost estimation to guarantee that the allocated budget is precise and feasible. 

# '''Cost variance analysis''' <br> - The project team will analyze and distinguish between the actual cost in the budget and predicted cost estimates to pinpoint reasons for any discrepancies, then initiate remedial measures to align expenses accordingly. 

# '''Cost management roles and responsibilities''' <br> - The project team members will define and establish clear roles and responsibilities for cost management. 

# '''Approval process for changes'''  <br> - Changes to projects or budgets will be approved formally through an established and implemented procedure. 

# '''Reporting and communication'''  <br> - Regular cost reports will be provided and distributed to the project team, project sponsor, and management to inform every one of the project's financial situations. 

By implementing a clear cost management approach in SurveiRams, the project team can help ensure that the project stays on budget and meets financial objectives. This can help to minimize the risk of cost overruns and ensure that the project is completed successfully. 


==8.3 Measuring Project Costs==

For this project, the Earned Value Management tool will be used to measure project costs. Specifically, the Cost Variance (CV), Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Performance Index (CPI), and Schedule Performance Index (SPI) are the metrics to be used to aid in tracking whether the project is over or under budget, or whether the team is on schedule or not.  

<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">
<tr>
<td width="400" bgcolor="lightblue">
<p><strong>Metrics</strong></p>
</td>
<td width="190" bgcolor="lightblue">
<p><strong>Formula/Definition</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="400">
<p>Schedule Variance (SV)</p>
</td>
<td width="190">
<p>EV - PV</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="400">
<p>Cost Variance (CV)</p>

<td width="190">
<p>EV - AC</p>
</td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="400">
<p>Cost Performance Index (CPI)</p>
</td>
<td width="190">
<p>EV / AC</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Table 1 shows the formula to calculate for each metric. SV is the difference between the EV and PV. It will determine whether the project is ahead (SV > 0), right on track (SV = 0), or behind schedule (SV < 0) in a specific timeframe or task. Meanwhile, CV is the difference between EV and AC. This dictates whether the project is under budget (CV > 0), perfectly on budget (CV = 0), or over budget (CV < 0) during a certain period. 

On the other hand, CPI is the ratio of the EV to the AC. This will help in checking if the project is cost-effective. If the CPI is: 

* less than one (a negative number), then it means that the project is over budget so far 

* equal to one (1), then it means that the project is perfectly on budget so far 

* more than one (a positive number), then it means that the project is over budget so far 

The Schedule Performance Index, which is the ratio of the EV to the PV, is similar to the SV, only in terms of the overall timeline. The aim is to consistently have an SPI that is either very close to 1, or if possible, be a little under 1. 

==8.4 Reporting Format==

Reporting on cost management will be included in the monthly project status report.  The Monthly Project Status Report will include a section labeled, “Cost Management”.  This section will contain the Earned Value Metrics identified in the previous section.  All cost variances outside of the thresholds identified in this Cost Management plan will be reported on including any corrective actions which are planned.  Change Requests which are triggered based upon project cost overruns will be identified and tracked in this report. 

==8.5 Cost Variance Response Process==

The Control Thresholds for this project is a CPI or SPI of 1, as stated above in the Measuring Project Cost. 

If the Project Sponsor selects a corrective action option, they may choose from the following:  

* Reducing the scope of the project 
* Reducing the quality of the project deliverables 
* Increasing the budget for the project 
* Increasing productivity or efficiency of project team members 

The Project Manager will monitor the implementation of the corrective actions and provide regular updates to the Project Sponsor on the status of the project budget. If the project continues to exceed the Control Thresholds, the Project Manager will forward the issue to their Project Adviser for further action. 

==8.6 Cost Change Control Process==

The cost change control process will include the following steps: 

# '''Identification of Cost Change''' <br> - The Project Manager or any team member who identifies and proposes a potential cost change must document and bring it to the attention of the Project Sponsor through a cost change request form. 

# '''Analysis of the Cost Change''' <br> - The project team will analyze the cost change to determine its impact on the project schedule, budget, and overall performance.  

# '''Approval of the Cost Change'''  <br> - The Project Manager will present an analysis of the cost change to the Project Sponsor and other relevant stakeholders. The Project Sponsor will then approve or reject the cost change based on the analysis provided. 

# '''Implementation of the Cost Change'''  <br> - Once the cost change is approved, the Project Manager will update the project cost baseline and implement the necessary cost changes to the project plan in accordance with the project schedule and budget. 

# '''Tracking and Monitoring of the Cost Change'''  <br> - The Project Manager will track and monitor the cost change to ensure that it is implemented effectively and efficiently. The project team will regularly review the progress of the cost change and adjust as necessary. 

# '''Reporting on the Cost Change''' <br> - The Project Manager will report on the cost change to the Project Sponsor and other stakeholders. The report will detail the factors contributing to the cost change, its implications for the project timeline, budget, and quality of work, as well as the progress achieved in managing the situation. 

The cost change control process is a crucial aspect of managing the SurveiRams ticketing system project's financial aspects. By analyzing and approving cost changes, the project can ensure that it remains within the allocated budget and avoids any unexpected financial challenges. Regular reporting on cost changes will allow the project manager to keep the project sponsor and other key stakeholders informed of any financial updates and ensure transparency throughout the project's lifecycle. By adhering to this cost change control process, the SurveiRams ticketing system project can achieve its objectives and deliver quality results within the specified budget.

=9. SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLAN=

==9.1 Introduction==

Managing a project’s schedule is one of the most important things to do. Discussed in this document are Schedule Management Approach, Schedule Control, Schedule Changes and Thresholds, and Scope Change. These must be elaborated as schedules are not always set in stone. There are unforeseen risks that might occur that could offset a project’s schedule.

==9.2 Schedule Management Approach==
Once a preliminary schedule has been produced, the project team will regularly review and update the schedule to ensure that the project stays on track. In addition to the project schedule, Earned Value Measures will be used to monitor and compare budgeted or scheduled progress against actual progress. 

Any changes to the schedule will be communicated to all stakeholders in a timely manner. Regular monitoring and tracking of the project will be done to ensure adherence to the schedule. 

* The team will also utilize project management software to facilitate task tracking and ensure that deadlines are met.  
* The project manager will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the project against the schedule, identifying potential delays, and taking corrective action where necessary.  
* The team will also hold regular status meetings to discuss progress and identify any issues that need to be addressed.  
* The project manager will provide regular status reports to stakeholders, including the project sponsor, to keep them informed of the project's progress. 

==9.3 Schedule Control==
;Frequency of Updates and Reviews: 

:The project schedule will be updated on a weekly basis by the project manager. 
:A schedule review meeting will be held every week to review the progress of the project against the schedule. 
:Any changes to the schedule will be communicated to the project team and stakeholders within 48 hours of being made. 

;Roles and Responsibilities: 

:The project manager is responsible for maintaining and updating the project schedule, as well as communicating any changes to the team and stakeholders. 
:To ensure optimal project management and successful project delivery, the project team must finish all the required deliverables on time. 
:The project team is responsible for providing accurate and timely information to the project manager to help ensure the schedule is up-to-date and on track. 
:Stakeholders are responsible for reviewing the project schedule and providing feedback or concerns to the project manager in a timely manner. 

;Communicating Schedule and Progress: 

:The project manager will communicate the project schedule and progress to the project team and stakeholders on a regular basis. 
:Progress reports will be provided weekly to stakeholders, highlighting any major accomplishments or issues that may impact the project schedule. 
:The project manager will also provide a monthly schedule status report to stakeholders, which will include an updated schedule and any changes made during the month. 

In conclusion, effective schedule control is critical to the success of the SurveiRams project. By establishing clear roles and responsibilities and maintaining open communication with the project team and stakeholders, the project manager can ensure that the project stays on schedule and within budget. 

==9.4 Schedule Changes and Thresholds==

Schedule changes and thresholds are critical elements of project management. It is essential to have a defined process in place to ensure that any schedule changes are well-documented and approved by the appropriate project stakeholders. Before making any changes to the schedule, the project team must complete the "Schedule Change" form. This form must include the proposed changes, justification for the changes, and the potential impact on the project's timeline, budget, and resources. The project sponsor must approve the schedule change request, and the updated schedule must be communicated to all relevant stakeholders. By following this process, the project team can ensure that all schedule changes are transparent, well-documented, and aligned with the project's goals and objectives. 

The project manager is responsible for submitting a "Schedule Change" form to the project sponsor for approval before making any changes to the project schedule. Once approved, the project manager will update the schedule and communicate the changes and their impact to the project team and stakeholders. All change requests will be archived in the project records repository. 

==9.5 Scope Change==
The team will need to evaluate the impact of any change in project scope that is authorized by the project sponsor on the present timetable. When an issue arises in a project that requires a substantial revision of the project scope, a change proposal can be considered. The team should approach any modification carefully given that the outcome could have a favorable or negative impact on the project's advancement. Any team member may request modifications, but they must be submitted in the form of a project change request document to the project stakeholder. 

=10. WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE=

==10.1 Introduction==

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) has been developed to help clarify the project's goals and scope. The project is divided into smaller, more manageable components called work packages by the WBS, each of which represents a specific task that must be completed to achieve the project's overall objectives. The WBS acts as a hierarchical structure that aids in establishing a project schedule, budget, and resource plan as well as assisting the project team in understanding the relationships between various work packages. It is an essential tool for managing and controlling the SurveiRams System project because it also aids in tracking progress and spotting potential risks and problems.

==10.3 Hierarchical Structure==

This is a hierarchical structure outlining the various stages involved in the SurveiRams System, a project management system that aims to manage violations and track progress of related projects. The structure starts with the initiation stage, which involves creating a business case and conducting a feasibility study, followed by the development of a project charter and plan, analysis, design, testing, implementation, and finally, the close of the project. Each stage is further broken down into sub-stages, which provide detailed information on the specific tasks and responsibilities that need to be carried out to achieve the overall goal of the project. This structure is designed to ensure that the project is completed efficiently, effectively, and within the specified timeline and budget.
