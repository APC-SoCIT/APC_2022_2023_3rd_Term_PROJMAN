=3. COMPANY PROFILE=

The Barangay South Signal Village is one of the 28 barangays of Taguig City, Philippines. South Signal was formerly a part of Barangay Signal Village before being divided into four other barangays. The South Signal Village is composed of segregated areas from other barangays of Signal Village. The COMELEC Board of Canvassers duly confirmed the Barangay South Signal Village on December 19, 2008. 

The Barangay South Signal Village heavily relies on papers, and most of its records and documents are stored in its physical filing cabinets. With the advancement of technology, selected barangays are already using computers and electronic devices to provide service and carry out official transactions. However, most barangays are still stuck with manual-based operations. Every request made by their client would take minutes to perform because of the tedious search for records stored in their physical file cabinets, which delays client service. All the essential and relevant information is encoded into a spreadsheet or a logbook, which uses many papers. The team would like to introduce the document management system to keep track of records, providing services and complaints in a modern approach with the use of computers as a primary medium that can speed up the process and reduce the consumption of paper.  

=4. BUSINESS CASE=

==4.1 Executive Summary==

Barangay South Signal Village is facing challenges in providing efficient, transparent, and accessible services and information to its residents. The system involves manual processes, limited access to crucial data, and potential service delays. This situation negatively affects residents' overall satisfaction and trust in their Barangay. 

To address these issues, the proposed Barangay South Signal Village Web Application project aims to create a digital platform that improves access to information and service provisions. This platform will improve residents' access to vital services, facilitate community and local government communication, and promote transparency.

The web application will provide a range of benefits, including reduced processing time and effort for residents, support for vulnerable community members, error elimination through online forms, real-time insights for barangay staff, secure cloud-based data storage, and reliable information dissemination.

Aligned with the organization's strategic goals, the project supports the continuous improvement of residents' quality of life, adaptation, and innovation to meet evolving needs, and increased satisfaction and trust in local government through exceptional service and support.

Upon successful implementation, the Barangay South Signal Village Web Application project will contribute to the long-term success of the community, creating a more connected, efficient, and transparent environment for residents to thrive in.

===4.1.1 Issue===

The proposed project aims to address several problems with the current system of Barangay South Signal Village. These problems include long processing time, which can take up to an hour; the risk of acquiring disease/s due to in-person requests; common errors in manual input; the need for manual search of records; and the lack of secure data storage. These issues impact the efficiency, accuracy, and safety of the barangay's processes.  

===4.1.2 Anticipated Outcomes===

The project anticipates a functional centralized and live web application that can manage, and process request barangay, as well as submit concerns from the residents of Barangay South Signal Village to the Barangay South Signal Officials by the end of year 2023. This web app will be implemented and deployed in the cloud server managed by the Barangay Administrator who will maintain the overall system. The proposed system should include all necessary functionalities, such as the general web pages of the web application, resident and barangay employee dashboards, and processing requested barangay documents and concerns. 

If the proposed project is implemented, the Barangay South Signal Village Officials will primarily benefit from its ability to digitize their transactions and share valuable information about their barangay. It will also provide a new and easier way to process and record paperless barangay documents and concerns online, streamlining their operations and improving efficiency. The project will provide barangay staff with real-time insights on the number of requests per day, the number of pending requests, the number of online requests, and the number of registered accounts via their dashboards, which will help with their statistics. Additionally, the project will help officials to securely store data in the cloud, which saves data over the internet and can only be accessed by the administrator or the barangay employee by logging in to their account. This makes data more secure and easier to access than using filing cabinets. 

Barangay South Signal Village Residents will also benefit from this project when implemented because they will have a new and effortless way to access public information about their barangay. It will also help them to have a new and easier way to request barangay documents ahead of time without having to wait in line and spend time requesting at the barangay.  

===4.1.3 Recommendation===

After careful analysis of the needs and requirements of Barangay South Signal Village, we strongly recommend the development and implementation of a web app to enhance the communication and service delivery of the barangay to its constituents. The proposed web app will serve as a one-stop-shop platform that will allow the residents of Barangay South Signal Village to access information, request services, and interact with the barangay officials and employees through a user-friendly and secure interface. The web app will be accessible through desktop and mobile devices, making it convenient for all residents to use. 

We believe that the web app is necessary and beneficial for Barangay South Signal Village for several reasons. For starters, the web app will facilitate efficient communication between the barangay officials and the residents, thereby improving transparency, and accountability, and fostering a closer relationship between the barangay and its constituents. Second, the web app will streamline the delivery of services and reduce the need for physical visits to the barangay hall, increasing the efficiency of the barangay's operations and reducing waiting times for residents. Third, the web app will be a cost-effective solution compared to the traditional methods of communication and service delivery, resulting in cost savings for the barangay and improving the utilization of resources. Fourth, the web app will provide a centralized platform for data management, allowing the barangay officials to easily access and analyze data on the residents' requests, complaints, and feedback. Finally, the web app will give Barangay South Signal Village a competitive advantage in terms of service delivery and communication compared to other barangays that do not have a similar platform, thereby enhancing its reputation and attracting more residents and businesses to the area. 

===4.1.4 Justification===

Digitalizing the manual and paper processes of Barangay South Signal Village will increase productivity and decrease the errors brought upon by manual processes. Having a web application also increases the range of the services that the barangay can give, from on-site to remote services, which results in a projected increase in sales.  

If the Barangay South Signal Web App is not implemented, the barangay stays with manual transactions that (according to the barangay secretary) has an estimated amount of 5-6 documents per 10 requests which contain errors. The barangay will also be putting the residents and the employees at risk through physical transactions which have been proven by the recent pandemic.

===4.3.1 Problem Statement===

Barangay South Signal Village is a local community in the Philippines where residents often face difficulties accessing vital information and services the local government provides. Currently, there needs to be a centralized platform for residents to access the necessary resources and services, leading to inefficiencies in communication and service delivery. 

The absence of a user-friendly and accessible web application has resulted in delays and dissatisfaction for residents who require information on local policies, programs, and services. Furthermore, the manual processes for availing various services, such as securing permits and filing complaints, contribute to longer waiting times and potential errors. 

The Barangay South Signal Village Web Application project aims to address these challenges by developing an integrated and accessible platform that streamlines residents' access to information and services. This will help improve communication between the local government and its constituents, enhance service delivery, and ultimately raise the overall quality of life for the residents. 

===4.3.2 Organizational Impact===

The barangay south signal village web application is to build a centralized and live web application for barangay south signal village residents. Wherein they can post their barangay profile, history, demography, and organizational chart. They can also list their contacts and requirements guidelines here. The proposed project will also implement a new role for their barangay employees to manage and work the app, these are the barangay secretary, web-app administrator, and the barangay captain. This will help them to manage and sort out everything easier and more quickly compared to their current system. 

===4.3.1 Technology Migration===

The development of the Barangay South Signal Village Web App will involve the use of different web development technologies. For the back end of the web application, the team will use LARAVEL, an open-source PHP web framework known for its ease of use and powerful features. In front-end development, BLADE.PHP, a templating engine used in the Laravel PHP framework that offers a simple and effective way to create reusable front-end designs using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP syntax, will be utilized by the team. For managing the data in the web app, the team will use MYSQL, a popular and reliable database management system that enables data storage and retrieval. By utilizing these technologies, the Barangay South Signal Village Web App will be developed to deliver an optimal user experience and meet the needs of the stakeholders. 

In terms of data migration, all raw data can be accessed and modified either in the Barangay Employee portal of the web app or in GoDaddy’s cPanel where it will be deployed. The data can be exported into Excel, CSV, or pdf files from the database.  

==4.4 Project Overview==
===4.4.1 Project Description===

In order to address the issue of manual transactions having long processing times and leading to typographical errors as well as potential harm to the health of both the residents and the employees, the project aims to develop a web application that digitalizes processes through online forms which help reduce typographical errors by up to 90% that also lessens the processing time for the residents by automating the information to be filled out in the forms. Through the digitalization of the processes, physical transactions and interactions will be lessened since the resident will have a schedule of when they can receive the document they requested and not fall in line just to create a single request. 

The project projected an increase to about 2x the number of processes that can be processed per day through manual transactions. This will provide efficiency and effectiveness and transparency for the residents of the barangay. 

===4.4.2 Goals and Objectives===

This project aims to improve the experience faced by Barangay South Signal Village residents. The web application aims to provide online services to the barangay community. The project aims to provide a better user experience for the residents and prevent unnecessary delays, confusion, and inefficiencies in accessing information and availing services. 

To achieve these goals, the specific objectives of the project are: 
* Develop a web application to handle online document requests, reducing the processing time and effort for barangay residents by up to 80%. 

* Assist vulnerable residents, such as PWDs and seniors, by allowing them to request documents through the web app, reducing direct contact and the risk of contagious diseases like COVID-19. 

* Implement online forms to eliminate errors from illegible handwriting and decrease manual input mistakes by up to 90% through guided form filling. 

* Through a statistics dashboard, provide barangay staff with real-time insights on request metrics, pending requests, online submissions, and registered accounts. 

* Build a secure, cloud-based storage solution for data, accessible only to authorized personnel, offering 90% greater security than traditional filing cabinets. 

===4.4.3 Project Performance===

The success of the web app project for Barangay South Signal Village will be measured based on the following performance indicators: 
* User Adoption: The web app will be successful if it is widely adopted and used by the residents of Barangay South Signal Village. The adoption rate will be monitored through analytics and feedback mechanisms on the web app. 

* Service Delivery: The web app will be successful if it improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the barangay's service delivery. The time it takes to process requests, the number of complaints resolved, and the resident satisfaction levels will be monitored and measured through the web app.  

* Cost Savings: The web app will be successful if it results in cost savings for the barangay. The cost of development, maintenance, and marketing of the web app will be compared to the cost savings achieved through the reduction of physical infrastructure and manual processing. 

* Data Management: The web app will be successful if it provides a centralized platform for data management and analysis. The accuracy and completeness of data on the web app, as well as the insights and decisions derived from the data, will be monitored and measured.  

* Competitive Advantage: The web app will be successful if it gives Barangay South Signal Village a competitive advantage in terms of service delivery and communication. The reputation of the barangay, as well as the number of new residents and businesses attracted to the area, will be monitored and measured.  

Based on these performance indicators, we believe that the web app project for Barangay South Signal Village has a high potential for success. The web app will be monitored and evaluated regularly to ensure that it meets the performance targets and achieves the desired outcomes for the barangay and its constituents.

==7.7 Scope Verification ==

The project team that facilitates the Barangay South Signal Web App project will conduct scope verification with the client and the project adviser every meeting to ensure that the deliverables are in line with the original scope. This will guarantee that the deliverables are accepted by the client and the project advisor and will ensure that the project will be finished on time and within the scope and budget. 

==7.8 Scope Control ==

The project team will make sure that every change that happens within the project's scope is effectively communicated with the client and approved. The team will also adhere to proper documentation regarding the change within the scope to ensure that there is transparency between the team and the client.  

=8. COST MANAGEMENT PLAN=

==8.1 Introduction==

The Cost Management Plan for the Barangay South Signal Village Web App project is designed to ensure that all costs associated with the project are effectively managed throughout its lifecycle. The plan outlines the format and standards by which the project costs will be measured, reported, and controlled. 

# '''Cost management responsibilities''' 
* The Project Manager will be responsible for overall cost management of the project and will be the primary point of contact for all cost-related issues. 
* The Finance Team will be responsible for monitoring project costs and ensuring that they are within the approved budget. 
# '''Cost change approval''' 
* All cost changes must be approved by the Project Manager before they are implemented. 
* If the cost change exceeds 10% of the total project budget, it must be approved by the Project Sponsor before it can be implemented. 
# '''Cost measurement and reporting'''
* Costs will be measured and reported monthly, using a cost performance index (CPI) and a schedule performance index (SPI). 
* Reports will be presented to the Project Sponsor on a monthly basis. 
# '''Budget format and standards''''
* The budget will be presented in a clear and concise format, using a spreadsheet format such as Excel. 
* The budget will be broken down into individual line items, with detailed cost estimates for each item. 
* The budget will be updated on a monthly basis, with any changes clearly highlighted. 

Overall, the Cost Management Plan for the Barangay South Signal Village Web App project is designed to ensure that all costs associated with the project are effectively managed and controlled, so that the project can be completed within the approved budget. This will help ensure that the project is completed successfully and on time. 

==8.2 Cost Management Approach ==

The cost management approach for the Barangay South Signal Village Web App will be based on the following principles: 

# '''Cost Estimating: ''' <br> The project team will use a bottom-up approach to estimate the costs associated with developing and launching the web app. This approach involves breaking down the project into smaller tasks and estimating the cost of each task based on the resources required. The team will use historical data from similar projects, industry benchmarks, and expert judgment to estimate costs accurately. 
# '''Budget Development ''' <br> Based on the cost estimates, the project team will develop a comprehensive project budget that covers all the costs associated with developing and launching the web app. The budget will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor or steering committee before it is finalized. 
# '''Cost Control ''' <br> Throughout the project, the project team will monitor actual costs against the approved budget to ensure that the project is on track financially. Any deviations from the approved budget will be documented and analyzed to determine the root cause. If necessary, corrective action will be taken to bring the project back in line with the budget. 
# '''Change Management ''' <br> Any changes to the project scope, timeline, or resources may have an impact on the project budget. Therefore, all changes will be reviewed by the project sponsor or steering committee to assess their impact on the budget. If the changes are approved, the project budget will be updated accordingly. 
# '''Reporting ''' <br> Regular cost reports will be produced and distributed to the project team, stakeholders, and the project sponsor or steering committee. These reports will show actual costs to date, compared to the approved budget, and any deviations from the budget. The reports will also include an analysis of the causes of any deviations and any corrective actions taken. 

By following this Cost Management Approach, we aim to ensure that the Barangay South Signal Village Web App project is completed within the approved budget, while still meeting the project objectives and delivering a high-quality product that satisfies the needs of the community. 

==8.3 Measuring Project Costs ==
==8.4 Reporting Format ==

The project team will generate a Monthly Project Status Report to update stakeholders on the cost status of the project. This report will include a "Cost Management" section that will highlight the Earned Value Metrics (EVM) previously mentioned, such as Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Variance (CV), Schedule Performance Index (SPI), and Cost Performance Index (CPI), to evaluate the project's progress and cost performance. In case the project's cost exceeds the predefined thresholds, the report will include details of the issue along with the planned corrective actions. The report will also monitor any change requests resulting from cost overruns to ensure that they align with the project budget. These updates will be shared with stakeholders on a monthly basis to maintain transparency and ensure timely decision-making. 

==8.5 Cost Variance Response Process ==

Develop a corrective action plan to address the cost variance. The plan should include specific actions to reduce or eliminate the cost variance, as well as timelines and responsibilities for each action. Communicate with stakeholders to keep them informed about the cost variance and the corrective action plan. Be transparent about the impact on the project's budget, schedule, and scope. Re-evaluate the project plan to ensure that it is still feasible given the cost variance. Consider whether any adjustments need to be made to the project's schedule, scope, or quality to bring it back in line with the budget. 

The Control Thresholds for this project are a CPI or SPI of less than 0.8 or greater than 1.2.  If the project reaches one of these Control Thresholds a Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan is required.  The Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with options for corrective actions within five business days from when the cost variance is first reported.  Within three business days from when the Project Sponsor selects a corrective action option, the Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with a formal Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan.  The Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan will detail the actions necessary to bring the project back within budget and the means by which the effectiveness of the actions in the plan will be measured.  Upon acceptance of the Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan it will become a part of the project plan and the project will be updated to reflect the corrective actions. 

==8.6 Cost Change Control Process ==

=9. SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLAN=
==9.1 Introduction==

The purpose of this Schedule Management Plan is to establish a clear, organized framework for managing the development and implementation of the South Signal Village Barangay Web Application Project. The significance of this plan lies in its ability to define the project timeline, coordinate team activities, ensure alignment with project goals, and allow for effective response to any changes or unexpected challenges. 

This plan provides an overview of the project's key phases, from initial planning to final project closeout, each broken down into manageable sprints according to Agile methodologies within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It lays out the critical milestones, target dates, and corresponding activities, ensuring every step of the project is clearly outlined. 

Moreover, the plan outlines the roles and responsibilities of each team member and stakeholder in maintaining the schedule and managing deviations. It introduces the approach for managing schedule changes and scope alterations, with a focus on thorough evaluation, documentation, and communication. 
 
==9.2 Schedule Management Approach==

Team Developmentality will utilize the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) throughout the project, specifically using the Agile Methodologies. The Software Development Cycle is one of the fundamental methods in developing software in a series of different phases. With the Agile method, the project will be broken down into smaller and more manageable parts called sprints. Each sprint focuses on delivering specific features or functionality that will guide the team thoroughly. 

* '''A. Scheduling Tool''' <br> The team will use Project Libre to plan and record the project's progress by activities and phases. Based on the team schedule and the project scope, the project will be divided into five main phases:

# '''Plannings''' <br> During this phase, the team defines the project's goals, requirements, scope, and objectives. The team then uses this information to develop a high-level project plan and a specific Sprint plan describing each sprint's activities and objectives. 
# '''Analysis and Design''' <br> During this phase, the team evaluates the system analysis and detailed design identified in the planning phase. The primary goal of this phase is to create necessary system requirements that will guide the development team in creating the software. 
# '''Development ''' <br> During this phase, the team will write codes and create the web app according to the created system analysis and detailed designs. 
# '''Implementation''' <br> During this phase, the team will test the system using functional and performance testing to ensure the web app works appropriately based on the client's needs. The team will create necessary documents in this phase, such as the user manual for the Closeout phase.
# '''Closeout''' <br> his phase will be the last phase of the project, wherein the team will hand over the system to the client.  

* '''B. Schedule Milestones''' <br> The project Summary Milestone Schedule is presented below.  As requirements are more clearly defined, this schedule may be modified.  Any changes will be communicated through project status meetings by the project manager.

==9.3 Schedule Control==

Schedule Control is essential for project success and requires collaborative work from all team members and stakeholders. To ensure the schedule is under control, different roles and responsibilities for schedule development are as follows: 

# '''Project Manager''' <br> responsible for developing and maintaining the project schedule, communicating progress to stakeholders, identifying, and managing schedule-related risks and issues, and updating the schedule as needed.
# '''Product Owner''' <br> works with the Project Manager and Scrum Team to ensure project deliverables align with the schedule, prioritize requirements according to the schedule, and provide input on changes to the schedule. 
# '''Scrum Master'''''' <br> ensures the team follows the schedule and Scrum framework, manages schedule-related risks and issues, and works with the Project Manager and Product Owner to ensure the project progresses according to the schedule. 
# '''Scrum Team''' <br> develops project deliverables according to the schedule, communicates schedule-related risks or issues to the Project Manager and Scrum Master, and adheres to the schedule. 
# '''Documentation Manager''' <br> ensures project documentation aligns with the schedule and provides updates on any changes to the schedule. 
# '''Stakeholders''' <br> accept project deliverables as defined by the schedule and provide input on changes to the schedule.
# '''Class Adviser and Project Adviser ''' <br> provide guidance on managing the project schedule and ensure alignment with relevant requirements and goals. 

To control the project schedule, it will be monitored, reviewed, and revised as needed, and the team will participate in updates and meetings, collaborate on changes, and resolve schedule variances. The Project Manager will update the client on the schedule status and submit any schedule change requests for approval. 

==9.4 Schedule Changes and Thresholds==

The boundary conditions will be thoroughly discussed by the team with the project client. The team will monitor the project schedule as the project progresses, this includes all the changes made outside of the original plan. The team will then identify if these changes exceed the boundary conditions and thresholds and how much it will affect the project schedule. If the project manager determines the changes go beyond the boundary conditions and does not meet the change threshold, a schedule change request will be created. The changes that do not meet the threshold will be discussed with the project sponsor for approval. Once the change request is approved, the project manager will be in charge of modifying the schedule and communicating any changes and their effects on the plan. The project manager must also let the project team, project sponsor, and stakeholders know about the changes that have been accepted. 

==9.5 Scope Change==

The team needs to document all scope changes, including the reason for the change, the impact on the project, and any changes to the project schedule or budget. Update the project plan to reflect any scope changes. Communicate all scope changes to stakeholders, including the impact on the project's budget, schedule, and quality. Be transparent about the reasons for the change and the expected outcomes. 

=10. WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE=

==10.1 Introduction==

The Work Breakdown Structure or WBS is a hierarchical breakdown of the project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components. The WBS provides a framework for the team for organizing their project work and helps them to identify the activities needed to complete their project.

The purpose of the WBS is to break down the project into manageable work packages that can be planned, monitored, and controlled. By breaking down the project into smaller components, it is easier for the team to estimate the effort required to complete each task, assign responsibilities to team members, and track progress against the project plan. It is an essential tool for project managers and provides a visual representation of the project scope and objectives. The WBS is a key component of the project management plan and is developed during the project's planning phase. The WBS helps the team to ensure that all project activities are accounted for, and nothing is overlooked or missed.

Listed below are the project deliverables, project work, activities required to complete each deliverable and the resources needed to complete the project. Such as choosing a project client, choosing a consultant, creating all papers needed for the project, and the expected labor to cost. 

The Work Breakdown Structure presented here represents all the work required to complete this project.

==10.2 Outline View==

The Barangay South Signal Village Web App is a comprehensive project aimed at developing a web application that caters to the needs of the residents in the Barangay. The project is divided into four phases, namely planning, analysis and design, development, and implementation, with each phase having specific tasks and deliverables.

==10.3 Hierarchical Structure==

The hierarchical structure makes it easy to see how the different components of a project fit together and how the work is distributed across the project team. It also helps to ensure that all the necessary work is identified and accounted for, which can reduce the risk of schedule delays or cost overruns for the team.

==10.4 Tabular View ==

The Tabular View shows the WBS for the Barangay South Signal Village Web App project, organized in a table format with four main categories: Planning, Analysis and Design, Development, and Implementation, with a fifth category for project closeout. Each category is broken down into subcategories and tasks, making it easier to track project progress and ensure timely completion of tasks.



==10.5 Tree Structure View==

==10.6 WBS Dictionary==

The WBS Dictionary is a document that contains all the essential details of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) required to complete a project successfully. It includes a definition of each Work Package, which acts as a mini scope statement. The WBS Dictionary is an important reference for project resources to understand the scope of the Work Package assigned to them. Typically, the WBS Dictionary includes more information than what is shown in the sample, such as Level of Effort, Cost Control Numbers, Resource Assignments, Responsibility Assignments, and other relevant information.
