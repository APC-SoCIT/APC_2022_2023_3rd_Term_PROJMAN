<blockquote>''Table 1—1: High-level Company Information''</blockquote>

Madonna’s Garden Resort and Event’s Place is a Public Resort in Malvar Batangas. It was established in 2020 as an easy access resort and event’s place for the people at Malvar, Batangas. The Business was built during the pandemic as a place where people can come to relax and swim. The place is deemed accessible as it is near the STAR Tollway which is an expressway that people can use to get to Batangas, and the place is also Near SM Lipa which is an Hour and a half trip from the Capital city, Manila.

Madonna’s Garden Resort and Event’s place can also be reserved to become a private resort with a fee which includes a lot of amenities and an event area which can be used in gathering and life events. Since its original opening in 2020, they begun expanding and renovating their business which started with one pool and a few cottages to adding another pool and building mini rest houses which can be reserved by guests.

'''Project: Reservation Management Website for the staff of Madonna’s Garden Resort and Events place'''

This project’s goals are to improve their reservation and booking system, improve their manual tasks, and help promote their business by creating a space for their advertising materials and content for their customers to see. Currently, their goal is to promote the business and improve its sales so that they can get a return on their investment. This project aims to help achieve their goals by helping them to improve the reservation and booking system and reduce manual and repetitive tasks helping them in improving their current system by digitalizing their task.

Under the supervision of Micheal James Gnilo and Team YouNIX, they have assembled a team of Computer Science Students to manage the Madonna’s Web: A reservation Website project. The project management team has sufficient experience in managing complex projects and is committed to delivering the project on time, within budget, and to the highest quality standards.

The project management team will collaborate closely with the stakeholders to identify and handle risks, create a comprehensive project plan, and guarantee adherence to the agreed-upon scope throughout project execution. Moreover, the team will provide regular status updates to the stakeholders and promptly address any issues or concerns that may arise.

= 2. Business Case  =

<span id="problem-definition"></span>
=== 2.1. Problem Definition  ===

<span id="problem-statement"></span>
==== 2.1.1. Problem Statement  ====

<blockquote>Madonna’s Resort and Events Center is a resort and events center which provides booking and reservation in their facilities, swimming in public or private pool, and having an event hall for company outing activities or organization activities. The resort is newly opened in Malvar, Batangas. They started creating the resort during the start of pandemic, way back 2020. Currently, they are using Google forms to be manually encoded by their staff and spreadsheets that they sometimes use whenever the form is inaccessible which sometimes causes conflicts in the reservation of facilities and date. 

There is a difference between the reservation and booking. The reservation is for the entrance fee of the individual on the resort who wants to use the pool and event center, while bookings are for the cottages and rooms of the customer.  
</blockquote>
<span id="organizational-impact"></span>
==== 2.1.2. Organizational Impact  ====

<blockquote>The implementation of the system will help improve the overall performance the Madonna’s resort staff since it will prevent more human errors and have their work more efficient when they are encoding the data of their customer during reservations and bookings. 
</blockquote>
<span id="technology-migration"></span>
====  2.1.3. Technology Migration  ====

<blockquote>The system will be developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development; For the backend development, Django with built-in SQLite, and Python 3, are used. This programming language and framework are what the website is composed of. In terms of data migration, since Django has a built-in database, it will be easy to export the data as there is an added feature for the staff of Madonna’s.  Once the development is finished, the implementation will be done through the business’ chosen hosting environment.
</blockquote>
<span id="project-overview"></span>
== 2.2. Project Overview  ==

<span id="project-description"></span>
==== 2.2.1. Project Description  ====

<blockquote>To address the issue of conflict of reservation and manual process of reservation, the project aims to develop a system which is a website that will help Madonna’s Resort on reservations, as well as blog and photo gallery. As an overview of these tools, reservations are done through filling out a form on the website and will redirect to a page that will produce a receipt which will then the customer can used to make a down payment on GCash since it is included in the receipt. This will then be transferred to the database that which admin and staff of the resort whose logged on the website can check, confirm, edit, and remove the receipt depending on the circumstances. Logging in on the website is only exclusive for the admin and staff of the resort and there is no redirection for the login page on the home page; It is provided only via a link. Blog is where the admin and staff post details and advertisements for the resort. They can add, edit, and delete posts on the blog and have complete control with no limitations to what they can publish. Only the admin and staff of the resort can publish a post. The photo gallery is where the resort can post their latest pictures and are categorized so that ease of sorting can help both the resort and customer see what they need to look at. It is configured through their account on the website that they can add and edit, which is like blog but is purposed for photo gallery. 

Doing this project will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Madonna’s Resort by providing them a website that combines all they needed that helps them track their changes better and publish what they want as they have control with no limitations on the website.

The primary benefit of this project is the improvement of efficiency and accuracy in booking and reservations, computation of sales, and advertising. The system will allow for faster response times, leading to improved customer satisfaction and reduced operational costs. 

'''Benefits:'''

Below are the identified benefits that the project can bring once fully implemented:
</blockquote>
* Improved admin and staff online interaction as they have control and no limitations to what they can do since the system has provided and resolved the need and lacking features than the multiple platforms they used.

* Maintenance cost less as the client only needed to provide the system a subscription fee for the chosen online cloud web hosting site for the project to be deployed online.

<span id="alternative-analysis"></span>
===  2.4.1 Alternative Analysis ===

<blockquote>An alternative analysis for the Madonna’s Web project could include the following options: 

'''Option 1: Do nothing (status quo) '''

In this option, the business would continue to use the platform and tools to maintain reservation and advertisement. 

'''Pros:''' No upfront and disruption to existing platforms and tools. 

'''Cons:''' Potential for ongoing costs and difficulties on the platform and tools they used which would lead to conflict of reservation, difficulty in reserving and advertising, and computation of sales. 

 

'''Option 2: Creating a website through hiring a group of professional developers. '''

In this option, the business will create a website that will resolve the difficulties and limitations they had on the existing platform they are using. 

'''Pros:''' Improved efficiency and effectiveness, have more direct control and develop to their liking. 

'''Cons:''' Possible increase cost due to the business needing to hire a team of professionals to create their website 

 

'''Option 3: Use of website builders '''

Multiple reasons for not selecting this option are that it is free but have limitations; It has multiple subscription tiers, and the maintenance cost is higher than creating or hiring developers; Lack of features even when subscribed which can be a disadvantage to the business if the feature, they want is lacking on the website builder.

<span id="technical-architecture"></span>
== 5.2. Technical Architecture  ==

<blockquote>Madonna’s Web will be hosted on a low-cost virtual private server (VPS) holding the source code of the entire front-end and back-end, as well as being the same machine that the domain is owned and deployed from.

The system will be hosted on an encrypted Linode VPS containing the source code to extend the security of the website as well as minimizing technical maintenance for the system. The domain will be registered using Google Domains.

The entire system is built using the Django web framework for Python. The backend is programmed entirely in Python while the front-end uses a combination of HTML, CSS, PHP,

and JavaScript. The database will run on the SQLite database engine for storing and managing relational data.

The technical architecture of the Madonna’s Web project is designed to ensure that the application is efficient, reliable, and secure. The architecture is based on a client-server model, where the client is a web browser, and the server is the application server.

To ensure the security of the application, the technical architecture will include a number of security measures. These will include user authentication and authorization, data encryption and transmission via SSL and HTTPS, and secure coding practices.

Overall, the technical architecture of the Madonna’s Web project will ensure that the application is robust, secure, and open to changes, and will provide a solid foundation for the successful delivery of the project.

<span id="introduction"></span>
==== 6.1.1. Introduction  ====

<span class="mark"></span>

<blockquote>The Stakeholder Management Strategy for Madonna Resort’s Madonna Web Project will be used to identify and classify project stakeholders; determine stakeholder power, interest, and influence; and analyze the management approach and communication methodology for project stakeholders. This will allow us to identify key influential stakeholders to solicit input for project planning and gain support as the project progresses. This will benefit the project by minimizing the likelihood of encountering competing objectives and maximizing the resources required to complete the project.

Early identification and communication with stakeholders are imperative to ensure the success of Madonna’s Web Project by gaining support and input for the project. Some stakeholders may have interests which may be positively or negatively affected by the Madonna’s Web Project. By initiating early and frequent communication and stakeholder management, we can more effectively manage and balance these interests while accomplishing all project tasks.
</blockquote>
<span id="identify-stakeholders"></span>
==== 6.1.2. Identify Stakeholders  ====

<blockquote>Madonna’s Web Project Team will conduct a brainstorming session to identify stakeholders for the project. The brainstorming session will include the primary project team and project sponsor. The session will be broken down into two parts. The first part will focus on internal stakeholders within Madonna’s Resort. These stakeholders may include functional managers, operations personnel, finance personnel, warehouse, and material handlers, and any other Madonna’s Resort employee who will be affected by the Madonna’s Web project. The second part of the session will focus on external stakeholders. These may include suppliers, trial customers, partner organizations, or any other individuals who reside outside of Madonna’s Resort.

The following criteria will be used to determine if an individual will be included as a stakeholder:
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><blockquote><p>Will the person or their organization be directly or indirectly affected by this project?</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Does the person or their organization hold a position from which they can influence the project?</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Does the person have an impact on the project’s resources (material, personnel, funding)?</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Does the person or their organization have any special skills or capabilities the project will require?</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Does the person potentially benefit from the project or are they able to resist this change?</p></blockquote></li></ol>

<blockquote>Any individual who meets one or more of the above criteria will be identified as a stakeholder. Stakeholders from the same organization will be grouped to simplify communication and stakeholder management.
</blockquote>
<span id="key-stakeholders"></span>
==== 6.1.3. Key Stakeholders  ====

<blockquote>As a follow on to Identify Stakeholders, the project team will identify key stakeholders who have the most influence on the project or who may be impacted the most by it. These key stakeholders are those who also require the most communication and management which will be determined as stakeholders are analyzed. Once identified, the Project Manager will develop a plan to obtain their feedback on the level of participation they desire, frequency and type of communication, and any concerns or conflicting interests they have.

Based on the feedback gathered by the project manager, the determination may be made to involve key stakeholders on steering committees, focus groups, gate reviews, or other project meetings or milestones. Thorough communication with key stakeholders is necessary to ensure all concerns are identified and addressed and that resources for the project remain available.

<blockquote>Madonna's Web will accomplish developing a website that integrates reservation system and other website elements that will be promoted online. Where the customer can easily reserve a cottage and other amenities for the day of their reservation with the aid of the online booking system. By including a monthly sales report for the resort and digitizing it so that management can quickly examine their profit and track the days and weekly sales of Madonna's Resort, the developers will also add analytics to the project to sort documents.
</blockquote>
<span id="project-scope-statement"></span>
==== 6.2.5. Project Scope Statement  ====

<blockquote>The project scope statement for the Reservation Website project will detail the project's deliverables and the work necessary to create these deliverables.

'''Product Scope Description''' – Madonna's Web will accomplish developing a website that integrates reservation system and other website elements that will be promoted online. Where the customer can easily reserve a cottage and other amenities for the day of their reservation with the aid of the online booking system. By including a monthly sales report for the resort and digitizing it so that management can quickly examine their profit and track the days and weekly sales of Madonna's Resort, the developers will also add analytics to the project to sort documents.   

'''Product Acceptance Criteria''' – The developers created a functioning system that incorporates a reservation system and enables customers to quickly book a cottage or other amenities online. will be used by the programmers to build an interactive and user-friendly website that will be advantageous to both the client and the company. 

 

'''Project Deliverables'''

The integrated website that will help the Madonna’s reservation will make it easier to record and make a statement of schedule of the user. Then it will record the customer information to make an appointment. So, after Madonna’s Website is done the code will be processed which helps define the system and understand how it works and the researchers will pass it to the client once it is done. 

 

'''Project Exclusions'''   

Interactive Map – Similar to google maps but focuses on interacting only in the vicinity of Madonna’s Resort. It works by going through the interactive map page on the website and from there users can click the buildings which display the information or with the prices if they click the cottages. Due to time constraints, it has not been included in the project and it is outside of scope as the main objective is to have an online reservation system for the Madonna’ Resort. 

 

'''Project Constraints'''

The Madonna Web system's possible benefits in relation to costs will be determined with the aid of the cost-benefit analysis. This project's main advantage is the increase in efficiency and precision in reservations, sales calculations, and advertising. The system's quicker reaction times will increase customer satisfaction and lower operating expenses. Because it is an entry-level project and the framework used to develop the system is free, development and implementation have minimal cost. Because the client only had to pay a subscription fee to the system's preferred online cloud hosting provider for the project to go live online, maintenance costs were lower. 

   

'''Project Assumptions'''

The project's goal is to create a system, which includes a website with a blog and a photo gallery, to assist Madonna's Resort with reservations. To give an overview of these tools, reservations are made by filling out a form on the website, which directs to a page that generates a receipt that the consumer may use to pay a deposit using GCash because it is contained in the receipt. Then, depending on the situation, this will be transferred to the database where the resort's admin and staff who are logged in can check, confirm, edit, and remove the receipt. 
</blockquote>
<span id="work-breakdown-structure"></span>
==== 6.2.6. Work Breakdown Structure  ====

<blockquote>The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a method for dividing a project into smaller, easier-to-manage components. Each level of the WBS, which is hierarchical, represents an increasingly more in-depth picture of the project. The WBS Dictionary, a document that goes along with the WBS, offers comprehensive details about each component in the WBS, as well as the scope of work, deliverables, responsibilities, and any other pertinent information.

Using the WBS and WBS Dictionary, it is possible to assign responsibilities for each component of the project scope and break it down into smaller, easier-to-manage parts. By doing so, it is possible to make sure that every facet of the project is considered and that each team member is aware of their own responsibilities. To monitor development, pinpoint problems, find solutions, and make sure the project stays on course and within its stated parameters, the WBS and WBS Dictionary are also employed. All things considered, the WBS and WBS Dictionary are crucial tools for controlling the project scope and making sure the project is successful.

<li><blockquote><p>Documentation of the budgets will be conducted in case of any changes or updates in the costings.</p></blockquote></li></ul>

 

Overall, the Cost Management Plan of Madonna’s Web a Reservation System is designed to ensure the budgets are aligned and effectively managed and controlled. The cost management will also ensure that the project is successfully created and deployed.  

 

<span id="cost-management-approach"></span>
==== 6.3.1. Cost Management Approach  ====

<blockquote>This section explains the cost management approach of Madonna’s Web project: 
</blockquote>
* Clear definition of costs: The team in charge of the project will collaborate extensively with stakeholders to precisely determine and record all the expenses related to the project, such as wages, supplies, machinery, and other costs. 
*  Budget development and tracking: A comprehensive budget for the project will be created and consistently revised during the project's duration, with expenses being monitored and communicated promptly. 
* Cost variance analysis: The project team will keep a close eye on expenses during the project and analyze any discrepancies to identify and rectify any instances of excessive spending or cost savings. 
*  Cost estimates: To ensure that the project budget is precise and practical, the project team will employ diverse cost estimation methods. 
* Reporting and communication: - Reports on expenses will be generated and distributed to stakeholders, including the project sponsor, project team, and management. 
* Cost management roles and responsibilities: Distinct roles and responsibilities for managing expenses will be established and effectively conveyed to all members of the project team. 
* Approval process for changes: - A process that need approval to implement new changes. 

<blockquote> By applying these principles and practices, the project team will effectively control costs and ensure that the project remains on track with the designated budget.
</blockquote>
<span id="measuring-project-costs"></span>
==== 6.3.2. Measuring Project Costs  ====

<blockquote>The Cost Management Plan for the Madonna’s Web project will include a detailed approach for measuring project costs using Earned Value Management (EVM). This will involve capturing and reporting on various Earned Value metrics, such as:
</blockquote>
# Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) - These measures the budgeted costs of the work that was planned to be completed at a specific point in time.
# Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) - These measure the budgeted costs of the work that has been completed at a specific point in time.

<blockquote>3. Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) - This measures the actual costs incurred for the work that has been completed at a specific point in time.

These metrics will be used to perform cost variance analysis (CV), schedule performance index (SPI), and cost performance index (CPI) to measure the project's cost performance over time.

To assist in capturing these metrics, the project team will use project management software that is capable of tracking and reporting on EVM metrics. This software will also be used to forecast future project costs, and to review cost performance over time, across work packages or schedule activities.
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>Cost Variance (CV) measures the difference between the actual cost and the planned cost of the project. It is calculated by subtracting the actual cost from the planned cost. A negative CV indicates that the project is over budget, while a positive CV indicates that the project is under budget.</p></li>
<li><p>The Schedule Performance Index (SPI) measures the project's schedule performance by comparing the planned schedule to the actual schedule. This index is calculated as the ratio of the BCWP to the BCWS. It is calculated by dividing the earned value by the planned value. A value of 1 indicates that the project is on schedule, while a value less than 1 indicates that the project is behind schedule, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the project is ahead of schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>The Cost Performance Index (CPI) measures the project's cost performance by comparing the actual cost to the planned cost. This index is calculated as the ratio of the BCWP to the ACWP. It is calculated by dividing the value earned by the actual cost. A value of 1 indicates that the project is on budget, while a value less than 1 indicates that the project is over budget, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the project is under budget.</p></li></ol>

<blockquote>'''.'''

In summary, the Cost Management Plan will ensure that the project costs are effectively managed and controlled throughout the project’s lifecycle by using Earned Value Management metrics, schedule performance index, and cost performance index. These metrics will help the team to identify the areas where the project is underperforming and take corrective actions to bring the project back on track.
</blockquote>
<span id="reporting-format"></span>
==== 6.3.3. Reporting Format  ====

<blockquote>To effectively present the cost management plan for the Madonna Web System Project, a detailed spreadsheet or table would be the recommended reporting format. This format will cover all pertinent cost information, including the project budget, actual costs incurred, projected costs, and any variances or discrepancies that may occur.

The reporting format for the cost management plan of the Madonna’s Web Project would include the following elements:
</blockquote>
# '''Executive Summary''': An overview of the cost management plan, including the project's budget, any significant cost differences, and the actions taken to address them.
# '''Budget Overview:''' A detailed breakdown of the project's budget, showing the total project cost, costs for each phase or deliverable, and expenses related to various project resources (e.g., labor, materials, equipment).
# '''Cost Variance Analysis''': A thorough analysis of variations between the actual costs incurred and the budgeted costs. This analysis explains the reasons behind the differences, their impact on the project, and the steps taken to resolve them.
# '''Budget Forecast''': An estimate of future project costs, considering potential variations and their potential effects on the overall project.
# '''Cost Management Metrics''': Key indicators measuring the project's cost performance, such as cost variance, cost performance index (CPI), and schedule performance index (SPI).
# '''Approval and Sign-off:''' A section for the project manager and key stakeholders to review, approve, and officially sign off on the cost management plan.
# '''Appendices''' Additional supporting documents, such as detailed cost breakdowns, invoices, or change request forms, included for reference. <span class="mark"> </span>

<span id="cost-variance-response-process"></span>
==== 6.3.4. Cost Variance Response Process  ====

The Cost Variance Response process for the Madonna’s Web project will be as follows:

# Identification of Variance:

* The project manager is responsible for detecting and reporting any variations in cost to the project sponsor.
** The project manager will employ earned value metrics and other cost management tools to identify and monitor discrepancies.

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Analysis of Variance:</p></li></ol>

* The Project Manager will analyze the variance to identify the root cause and develop corrective actions options.

* The Project Manager will also assess the impact of the variance on the project schedules and scope.

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Presentation of Options:</p></li></ol>

* The Project Manager will provide the Project Sponsor with various options for corrective action.
* The options will be based on the root cause of the variance and the impact on the project schedule and scope.

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Approval of Corrective Action:</p></li></ol>

* The Project Sponsor will review the options and approve an appropriate action to bring the project back on budget.
* This may include increasing the budget, reducing scope or quality, or implementing other corrective actions.

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Implementation of Corrective Action:</p></li></ol>

* The Project Manager will also update the project schedule and budget accordingly.

<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Reporting:</p></li></ol>

* In the Monthly Project Status Report, the Project Manager will incorporate information about the cost variance, specifics regarding the corrective actions implemented, and the outcomes achieved.

* The Project Manager will consistently provide updates on the project's budget and schedule.

<blockquote>Throughout the project lifecycle, the Cost Variance Response process will remain active. The Project Manager will oversee the monitoring and control of project costs, while the Project Sponsor will have the responsibility of granting approval for any required corrective actions.
</blockquote>
<span id="cost-change-control-process"></span>
==== 6.3.5. Cost Change Control Process  ====

<blockquote>The cost change control process will include the following steps:
</blockquote>
* '''Identifying cost changes:''' The Project Manager will recognize and document any proposed adjustments to the project budget or expenses using a designated form for cost change requests.
* '''Analyzing cost changes:''' The project team will carefully examine the suggested modifications to assess how they might impact the project schedule, resources, and overall budget.

* '''Approval of the cost change:''' The cost change request will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor and other relevant stakeholders.
* '''Implementing cost changes:''' Once approved, the Project Manager will ensure the smooth execution of the cost changes according to the project schedule and budget.
* '''Tracking and monitoring cost changes:''' The project team will actively monitor and track the effects of the cost changes on the project schedule and budget, making necessary adjustments to keep the project on the right track.
* '''Reporting on cost changes:''' The Project Manager will include information about the cost changes, along with relevant financial details and any corrective actions taken, in the regular project status reports.

<blockquote>The cost change control process will be implemented to ensures that any changes to the project budget or expenses are promptly identified, carefully analyzed, and approved in a timely manner. By implementing this process, the project team aims to minimize the impact of cost changes on the project schedule and budget. Also, it helps to keep the project on track and aligned with its objectives.

<span id="schedule-management-plan"></span>
== 6.4. Schedule Management Plan  ==

<span id="introduction-2"></span>
==== 6.4.1. Introduction  ====

<blockquote>The project schedule is the roadmap for how the project will be executed. Schedules are an important part of any project as they provide the project team, sponsor, and stakeholders with a picture of the project’s status at any given time. The purpose of the schedule management plan is to define the approach the project team will use in creating the project schedule. This plan also includes how the team will monitor the project schedule and manage changes after the baseline schedule has been approved. This includes identifying, analyzing, documenting, prioritizing, approving, or rejecting, and publishing all schedule-related changes.
</blockquote>
<span id="schedule-management-approach"></span>
==== 6.4.2. Schedule Management Approach  ====

<blockquote>Project schedules will be created using OpenProject starting with the deliverables identified in the project’s Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Activity definition will identify the specific work packages which must be performed to complete each deliverable. Activity sequencing will be used to determine the order of work packages and assign relationships between project activities. Activity duration estimating will be used to calculate the number of work periods required to complete work packages. Resource estimating will be used to assign resources to work packages to complete schedule development.

Once a preliminary schedule has been developed, it will be reviewed by the project team and any resources tentatively assigned to project tasks. The project team and resources must agree to the proposed work package assignments, durations, and schedule. Once this is achieved the project sponsor will review and approve the schedule and it will then be baselined.

The following will be designated as milestones for the project schedule:
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote><p>Completion of scope statement and WBS/WBS Dictionary</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Baselined project schedule</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Approval of final project budget</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Project kick-off</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Approval of roles and responsibilities</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Requirements definition approval</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Completion of data mapping/inventory</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Project implementation</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Acceptance of final deliverables</p></blockquote></li></ul>

<blockquote>Roles and responsibilities for schedule development are as follows:

The project manager will be responsible for facilitating work package definition, sequencing, and estimating duration and resources with the project team. The project manager will also create the project schedule using OpenProject and validate the schedule with the project team, stakeholders, and the project sponsor. The project manager will obtain schedule approval from the project sponsor and baseline the schedule.

The project team is responsible for participating in work package definition, sequencing, and duration and resource estimating. The project team will also review and validate the proposed schedule and perform assigned activities once the schedule is approved.

The project sponsor will participate in reviews of the proposed schedule and approve the final schedule before it is baselined.

The project stakeholders will participate in reviews of the proposed schedule and assist in its validation.
</blockquote>
<span id="schedule-control"></span>
==== 6.4.3. Schedule Control  ====

<blockquote>The project schedule will be reviewed and updated as necessary on a bi-weekly basis with actual start, actual finish, and completion percentages which will be provided by task owners.

The project manager is responsible for holding bi-weekly schedule updates/reviews; determining impacts of schedule variances; submitting schedule change requests; and reporting schedule status in accordance with the project’s communications plan.

The project team is responsible for participating in bi-weekly schedule updates/reviews; communicating any changes to actual start/finish dates to the project manager; and participating in schedule variance resolution activities as needed.

The project sponsor will maintain awareness of the project schedule status and review/approve any schedule change requests submitted by the project manager.
</blockquote>
<span id="schedule-changes-and-thresholds"></span>
==== 6.4.4. Schedule Changes and Thresholds  ====

<blockquote>If any member of the project team determines that a change to the schedule is necessary, the project manager and team will meet to review and evaluate the change.  The project manager and project team must determine which tasks will be impacted, variance because of the potential change, and any alternatives or variance resolution activities they may employ to see how they would affect the scope, schedule, and resources.  If, after this evaluation is complete, the project manager determines that any change will exceed the established boundary conditions, then a schedule change request must be submitted. 

 

Submittal of a schedule change request to the project sponsor for approval is required if either of the two following conditions is true: 
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><blockquote><p>The proposed change is estimated to reduce the duration of an individual work package by 10% or more or increase the duration of an individual work package by 10% or more. </p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>The change is estimated to reduce the duration of the overall baseline schedule by 10% or more or increase the duration of the overall baseline schedule by 10% or more. </p></blockquote></li></ul>

<blockquote>Any change requests that do not meet these thresholds may be submitted to the project manager for approval. 

 

Once the change request has been reviewed and approved the project manager is responsible for adjusting the schedule and communicating all changes and impacts to the project team, project sponsor, and stakeholders.  The project manager must also ensure that all change requests are archived in the project records repository. 

 
</blockquote>
<span id="scope-change"></span>
==== 6.4.5. Scope Change  ====

<blockquote>Any changes in the project scope, which have been approved by the project sponsor, will require the project team to evaluate the effect of the scope change on the current schedule.  If the project manager determines that the scope change will significantly affect the current project schedule, he/she may request that the schedule be re-baselined in consideration of any changes which need to be made as part of the new project scope.  The project sponsor must review and approve this request before the schedule can be re-baselined. 

The process will include the following steps:

'''1. Identification of the scope change'''

a. The project team will identify any new deliverables or requirements that need to be added to the project.

'''2. Impact assessment'''
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><blockquote><p>The project team will assess the impact of the scope change on the project schedule and resources.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>This will include an evaluation of the additional time and resources required to complete the new deliverables or requirements, as well as any potential delays to the project schedule.</p></blockquote></li></ol>

<blockquote>'''3. Schedule and resource analysis'''

a. The project team will analyze the current status of the project schedule and resources to determine how the scope change will affect the project moving forward.

'''4. Approval process'''
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><blockquote><p>The scope change will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor and key stakeholders.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>The project sponsor will make the final decision on whether or not to proceed with the scope change.</p></blockquote></li></ol>

<blockquote>'''5. Implementation'''

a. Once the scope change is approved, the project team will integrate the new deliverables or requirements into the project schedule and resources.

'''6. Monitoring and control:'''

a. The project team will monitor the progress of the scope change and make any necessary adjustments to the project schedule and resources to ensure that the project remains on track.

'''7. Closeout:'''

a. The scope change will be closed out once all new deliverables or requirements have been completed and the project schedule and resources have been updated accordingly.

It is important to note that scope changes can have a significant impact on the project schedule and resources and must be managed carefully to ensure that the project stays on track and within budget.

<span id="staffing-management-plan"></span>
== 6.5. Staffing Management Plan  ==

<span id="introduction-3"></span>
==== 6.5.1. Introduction  ====

<blockquote>A strong human resource management strategy is critical to the success of any project. It acts as a template for how the project team will be managed and structured, and it assists in ensuring that the appropriate people with the right qualifications are in the right place at the right time. Roles and duties, communication protocols, and performance management measures are all part of the strategy. 

 

Using this plan, the project manager and project team can effectively manage the project by ensuring that all team members understand their roles and responsibilities, that communication is open and effective, and that performance is monitored and managed in a way that contributes to the project's overall success. 
</blockquote>
<span id="roles-and-responsibilities-1"></span>
==== 6.5.2. Roles and Responsibilities  ====

<blockquote>An effective human resources management plan is crucial for the successful completion of any project. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of all project team members and stakeholders, ensuring that everyone is aware of their individual contributions and how they fit into the bigger picture.

The plan also defines the level of authority and decision-making power held by each team member, ensuring that resources are allocated and utilized effectively. By clearly defining competencies and skill requirements, the plan ensures that the right people are in the right roles to achieve project success.

Overall, the human resources management plan acts as a roadmap for the project team, guiding them towards successful project execution and delivery.

== 6.6. Change Management Plan  ==

<span id="introduction-4"></span>
==== 6.6.1. Introduction  ====

<blockquote>The Change Management Plan was created for the Madonna’s Web Project to set expectations on how the approach to changes will be managed, what defines a change, the purpose and role of the change control board, and the overall change management process. All stakeholders will be expected to submit or request changes to Madonna’s Web in accordance with this Change Management Plan and all requests and submissions will follow the process detailed herein. 

 

CHANGE MANAGEMENT APPROACH 

 

The Change Management approach for Madonna’s Web will ensure that all proposed changes are defined, reviewed, and agreed upon so they can be properly implemented and communicated to all stakeholders. This approach will also ensure that only changes within the scope of this project are approved and implemented. 

 

The Change Management approach is not to be confused with the Change Management Process which will be detailed later in this plan. The Change Management approach consists of three areas: 
</blockquote>
* Ensure changes are within scope and beneficial to the project. 
* Ensure changes do not exceed the limitations of the project. 
* Determine how the change will be implemented. 
* Manage the change as it is implemented. 

<blockquote> 

The Change Management process has been designed to make sure this approach is followed for all changes. By using this approach methodology, Madonna’s Web development team will prevent unnecessary change from occurring and focus its resources only on beneficial changes within the project scope. 

 

DEFINITIONS OF CHANGE 

There are several types of changes which may be requested and considered for Madonna’s Web. Depending on the extent and type of proposed changes, changes to project documentation and the communication of these changes will be required to include any approved changes into the project plan and ensure all stakeholders are notified. Types of changes include: 

 
</blockquote>
* Scheduling Changes: changes which will impact on the approved project schedule. These changes may require fast tracking, crashing, or re-baselining the schedule depending on the significance of the impact. 
* Budget Changes: changes which will impact on the approved project budget. These changes may require requesting additional funding, releasing funding which would no longer be required, or adding to project or management reserves. May require changes to the cost baseline. 
* Scope Changes: changes which are necessary and impact on the project’s scope which may be the result of unforeseen requirements which were not initially planned for. These changes may also impact on the budget and schedule. These changes may require revision to WBS, project scope statement, and other project documentation as necessary. 

<blockquote> 

The project manager must ensure that any approved changes are communicated to the project stakeholders. Additionally, as changes are approved, the project manager must ensure that the changes are captured in the project documentation where necessary. These document updates must then be communicated to the project team and stakeholders as well.

<span id="change-control-board"></span>
==== 6.6.2. Change Control Board  ====

<blockquote>The Change Control Board (CCB) is the approval authority for all proposed change requests pertaining to Madonna’s Web. The purpose of the CCB is to review all change requests, determine their impacts on the project risk, scope, cost, and schedule, and to approve or deny each change request. The following chart provides a list of the CCB members for Madonna’s Web:

<blockquote>''Table 6.6—1: Change Control Board''

As change requests are submitted to the Project Manager by the project team/stakeholders, the Project Manager will log the requests in the change log and the CCB will convene every other Friday to review all change requests. For a change request to be approved, all CCB members must vote in favor. In the event more information is needed for a particular change request, the request will be deferred and sent back to the requestor for more information or clarification. If a change is deemed critical, an ad hoc CCB meeting can be called to review the change prior to the next scheduled bi-weekly CCB meeting.

<span id="communications-management-plan"></span>
== 6.7. Communications Management Plan  ==

<span id="introduction-5"></span>
==== 6.7.1. Introduction  ====

<blockquote>The Communications Management Plan is a critical component of the Madonna’s Web project as it outlines the communication strategy and protocols for the project team and stakeholders. The plan defines the following:
</blockquote>
# The plan details the information to be communicated, such as project updates, progress reports, risks, and issues, including the level of detail and format.
# The plan specifies the communication methods to be used, such as meetings, email, telephone, web portal, etc., to ensure timely information for all stakeholders.
# The plan sets the frequency of project communications, both formal and informal, to keep stakeholders regularly informed.
# The plan defines the roles and responsibilities of team members and stakeholders in communication, including who disseminates project information.
# The plan addresses the specific communication needs of all stakeholders, such as language requirements and accessibility.
# The plan allocates resources for communication, such as budget and personnel, to ensure effective and efficient communication.
# The plan sets protocols for communicating sensitive or confidential information, including authorization for release.
# The plan establishes a process for managing changes in communication or the communication process, including proposal, review, and approval of changes to ensure consistency throughout the project.
# The plan outlines the flow of communication within the project, including information sharing between team members, stakeholders, and other project partners to ensure timely information for all stakeholders.
# The plan identifies any internal or external constraints that may affect project communications and outlines how these constraints will be addressed.
# The plan specifies any standard templates, formats, or documents to be used for communicating project information to provide consistent and accurate information to all stakeholders.
# The plan includes an escalation process for resolving any communication-based conflicts or issues that may arise during the project to ensure timely resolution of communication-related issues.

<blockquote>Overall, the Communications Management Plan is a key tool that helps to ensure that all stakeholders are informed, and that communication is effective and efficient throughout Madonna’s Web project.
</blockquote>
<span id="communications-management-approach"></span>
==== 6.7.2. Communications Management Approach  ====

<blockquote>The most effective approach to managing communications for Madonna’s Web project would involve combining proactive and reactive strategies.

Proactively, regular project status meetings will be conducted to keep all stakeholders well-informed and updated on the project's progress. The project manager will regularly meet with the project team, providing updates, progress reports, and addressing any risks or issues. This approach will offer stakeholders a comprehensive overview of the project's status and potential obstacles. Additionally, a dedicated project website and web portal will be established, granting stakeholders convenient access to project-related information such as meeting minutes, documents, and status reports.

Reactively, an escalation process will be established to promptly address any conflicts or issues related to communication. The project manager will be readily available to respond to stakeholders' questions or concerns, offering support and guidance when necessary.

Moreover, a change control process will be implemented to manage any alterations in communication or the communication process. This process will involve obtaining approval from the Change Control Board and ensuring stakeholders are promptly informed of any changes. Overall, this approach guarantees that the project team and stakeholders remain well-informed, while effectively handling any communication-related challenges that may arise.
</blockquote>
<span id="communications-management-constraints"></span>
==== 6.7.3. Communications Management Constraints  ====

<blockquote>The Communications Management Constraints for Madonna’s Web project define and posits the constraints, limitations and boundaries that may affect the project’s communication processes and strategies. By identifying and addressing these constraints, the project team can mitigate scope creeping and prevent unnecessary additional problems to deter the business requirements.

The constraints laid out below define the limitations of the project to prevent overreach and additional problems from arising.

Communications management constraints for the Madonna’s Web project may include:
</blockquote>
# '''Limited budget for communication''' tools and resources such as video conferencing software, project management software, or hiring a dedicated communications team may be a constraint.
# '''Limited access to certain stakeholders''' located in remote locations or with limited access to certain forms of communication may be a constraint.
# '''Limited availability of team members''' due to other commitments or responsibilities may be a constraint.
# '''Language barriers''' may require translation services or additional resources to facilitate communication.
# '''Confidentiality''' of some project information may require special handling and communication protocols.
# '''Resistance to change''' in communication processes or tools by some stakeholders can make it difficult to implement new communication strategies.
# '''Technical difficulties''' with communication tools and systems can be a constraint.
# '''Time constraints''' due to tight project deadlines can make it challenging to schedule and hold regular communication meetings.

<span id="stakeholder-communication-requirements"></span>
==== 6.7.4. Stakeholder Communication Requirements  ====

<blockquote>This section of the Communications Management Plan outlines the specific communication needs of stakeholders and how they will be met throughout the project's lifecycle.

The Stakeholder Communication Requirements are a crucial part of Madonna’s Web project as they detail the specific communication needs of all stakeholders. Effective communication is essential for completing the project on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders. By identifying and addressing stakeholders' communication requirements, the project team can proactively manage expectations, build trust, and foster collaboration.

This section of the Communications Management Plan outlines stakeholders' specific communication needs and how they will be met throughout the project's lifecycle.

The Madonna’s Web project would probably require stakeholder communication needs such as:
</blockquote>
# '''Regular project updates:''' It is imperative to consistently inform all stakeholders about the project's progress, including the disclosure of any emerging issues or risks.
# '''Clear and concise communication:''' Project-related information needs to be conveyed in a manner that is easily understood and succinct, ensuring stakeholders comprehend the message effectively.
# '''Accessibility:''' Communication should be accessible to all stakeholders, considering any language or accessibility requirements they may have.
# '''Timely communication:''' Information should be communicated promptly, guaranteeing that stakeholders receive it in a timely manner, without delays.
# '''Confidentiality:''' Sensitive or confidential information must only be shared with relevant stakeholders and handled securely to maintain confidentiality.
# '''Customized communication:''' Communication should be tailored to meet the specific needs of each stakeholder, considering their level of involvement in the project and their respective roles.
# '''Two-way communication:''' Effective communication involves active participation from both parties, allowing stakeholders to provide feedback and seek clarification through meaningful dialogue.
# '''Feedback mechanisms:''' Mechanisms should be in place to facilitate stakeholder feedback on the communication process, ensuring continuous improvement and effectiveness.

<span id="communication-methods-and-technologies"></span>
==== 6.7.7. Communication Methods and Technologies  ====

<blockquote>The Madonna’s Web project requires a deep understanding of the communication methods and technologies used to effectively communicate with stakeholders. It’s important to consider the capabilities and limitations of each method and technology to ensure stakeholders receive timely and efficient information. This includes determining the appropriate methods for delivering project updates, progress reports, risks, issues, and other relevant information.

It’s important to consider the cost and feasibility of using different technologies, as well as any security or privacy concerns. By carefully selecting the most appropriate communication methods and technologies, the project team can ensure that all stakeholders are kept informed and that the project’s communication objectives are met.

When determining the best communication methods and technologies for Madonna’s Web several factors should be considered. These include:
</blockquote>
* '''The scope and complexity of the project:''' Business Communication Platform and project management software are frequently the best option when dealing with large-scale and complex projects since they make it easier to gather information and give all stakeholders easy access.
* '''The technical proficiency of the stakeholders:''' For stakeholders without technical proficiency, direct communication techniques like email and phone may be the best option.
* '''The type of information being communicated:''' Using secure techniques like encryption and password-protected platforms may be necessary when dealing with sensitive or confidential material.
* '''The project's budget and resources:''' Communication strategies and technology should be chosen in accordance with the project's allotted budget and resources.

<blockquote>Based on the factors mentioned earlier, it is recommended that the Madonna’s Web project use a combination of communication methods and technologies such as project management software, email, telephone, and video conferencing to keep all stakeholders informed and meet the project's communication objectives.

<span id="guidelines-for-meetings"></span>
==== 6.7.10. Guidelines for Meetings  ====

<blockquote>Meetings are a crucial part of effective communication in any project, including Madonna’s web project. To ensure productive, efficient, and effective meetings, it’s important to establish clear guidelines. These guidelines should include information on the purpose of meetings, roles and responsibilities of attendees, and procedures to follow during meetings.

With well-defined guidelines, project team members and stakeholders can be better prepared for meetings and participate more effectively. The project manager can also ensure that meetings are conducted consistently and organized to avoid confusion and misunderstandings.

Below are the meeting guidelines for Madonna’s web project:
</blockquote>
* '''Purpose:''' Meetings serve as an essential tool for discussing project status, finding solutions to problems, and reaching decisions for the Madonna’s web project.
* '''Scheduling:''' It is important to plan meetings in advance and at times that are convenient for all participants. Meeting invitations and scheduling are the project manager's responsibilities.
* '''Attendance:''' Unless they have a legitimate excuse, all project team members and stakeholders are required to attend meetings. Team members should let the project manager know as soon as possible if they won't be able to attend.
* '''Agenda:''' Prior to the meeting, an agenda specifying the subjects to be covered and the desired results should be distributed. Doing agendas will be made sure that everyone is ready and that the meeting keeps on schedule.
* '''Minutes:''' Minutes of the meeting should be recorded and given to all participants within 24 hours. A summary of the conversations, the conclusions made, and the assigned action items should all be included in the minutes.
* '''Decisions:''' Whenever achievable, decisions should be reached by consensus. If agreement cannot be obtained, the project sponsor will have final say.
* '''Follow-up:''' The project manager oversees making sure that action items are followed up on and finished on schedule.
* '''Communication:''' Project updates and problems are discussed during meetings. Participants should be urged to speak honestly and openly.
* '''Technology:''' Accessible technology should be used during meetings for all participants. This could involve web conferences, video conferences, or teleconferences.
* '''Time management:''' Meetings must begin and end on schedule, and they must not last longer than allocated. By doing this it will be made sure that attendees aren't kept waiting, and the project will finish on time.
* '''Evaluation:''' To ensure that meetings are successful and that participants are happy with the results, they should be frequently evaluated. Any problems must be resolved, and improvements made.

<span id="communication-standards"></span>
==== 6.7.11. Communication Standards  ====

<blockquote>The best communication standards for Madonna’s Web project may include the following:
</blockquote>
* '''Standardized Templates:''' Developing and using standard templates for project communications, such as status reports, meeting agendas, and minutes, can ensure consistency and clarity in the information being shared.
* '''File Naming Convention:''' Developing a standard file naming convention for documents and files shared on the project can help ensure easy access and organization of information.
* '''Network Tool:''' Utilizing a standard platform, such as SharePoint or project management software, for project communication can improve access to information and collaboration among team members and stakeholders.
* '''Video conferencing:''' Use of Video conferencing tools, Specifically Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet, can be very useful for team members and stakeholders who are located at different geographic locations.
* '''Communication protocols:''' Having a standard communication protocol in place for sensitive or confidential information, such as who is authorized to share it and how it should be shared, can ensure the protection of sensitive data.

<span id="communication-escalation-process"></span>
==== 6.7.12. Communication Escalation Process  ====

<blockquote>The ideal and best communication escalation process for the Madonna’s web project would involve the following steps:
</blockquote>
# '''Identify the issue:''' The first step for the project team in escalating a communication-related issue is to identify the issue that needs to be escalated.
# '''Attempt to resolve the issue within the team:''' The project team should first try to resolve the communication-related issue within the team by discussing it with relevant team members and finding a solution.
# '''Involve a communication manager:''' If the communication-related issue cannot be resolved within the team, the team should involve a communication manager or a designated person responsible for communication within the organization. This person will act as a liaison between the project team and stakeholders to help resolve the issue.
# '''Escalate to higher management:''' If the communication-related issue still cannot be resolved, it should be escalated to higher management for further review and resolution.
# '''Document the issue and resolution:''' During the escalation process, it’s important to document the issue, the steps taken to resolve it, and the final resolution to keep proper records for future reference.
# '''Review and Improve:''' After the escalation process, it’s important to review the process to identify areas for improvement for future escalations.

<blockquote>The escalation process should be flexible and adaptable to the specific needs of the project. The project team should regularly review the escalation process to ensure it remains effective and efficient in addressing communication-related issues.

<blockquote>The quality management approach for the Madonna’s Web project will ensure quality is planned for both the product and processes. To be successful, this project will meet its quality objectives by utilizing an integrated quality approach to define quality standards, measure quality, and continuously improve quality.

Product quality for the Madonna’s Web project will be defined by the company’s current standards and criteria for its Resort Management System. The focus is on the project’s deliverable, and the standards and criteria being used will ensure the product meets established quality standards and customer satisfaction.

Process quality for the Madonna’s Web project will focus on the processes by which the project deliverable will be manufactured. Establishing process quality standards will ensure that all activities conform to an organizational standard which results in the successful delivery of the product.

The project team will work with the Quality Group to define and document all organizational and project specific quality standards for both product and processes. All quality documentation will become part of the Madonna’s Web Project Plan and will be transitioned to operations upon the successful completion of the project.

Metrics will be established and used to measure quality throughout the project life cycle for the product and processes. The Quality Group Manager will be responsible for working with the project team to define these metrics, conduct measurements, and analyze results. These product and process measurements will be used as one criterion in determining the success of the project and must be reviewed by the project sponsor. Metrics will include:
</blockquote>
* Schedule
* Resources
* Cost
* Process performance
** System deployment
* Product performance
** System reliability
* Customer Satisfaction (because of field trials)

<blockquote>Quality improvements will be identified by any member of the project team or quality group. Each recommendation will be reviewed to determine the cost versus benefit of implementing the improvement and how the improvement will impact the product or processes. If an improvement is implemented the project manager will update all project documentation to include the improvement and the quality manager will update the organizational documentation the improvement affects.

==  6.11. Implementation Plan  ==

<span id="executive-summary"></span>
==== 6.11.1. Executive Summary  ====

<blockquote>A transition out plan has been developed to make the system's smooth transfer to its new owners during the project closeout phase as the Madonna's web project nears completion. The contract history, the current system status, and the intended handover to the new owners are all covered in this plan, which provides an overview of the transition process.

Our company and the client worked together to improve their online and reservation operations with the Madonna's web system. The system has been used effectively over the past year, achieving the project's goals. The client is now taking ownership of the system, as stipulated in the contract agreement.

After undergoing extensive testing, validation, and user training, the system is now stable and fully operational. Our goal is to provide the client with all the documentation and support they need to effectively manage and maintain the system as we move forward with the transition.

All project deliverables, including source code, user manuals, and technical documentation, will be provided to the new owners to ensure that they have a thorough understanding of the system. In addition, we will provide the new owners with the necessary expertise through knowledge transfer sessions that cover system operations, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

A detailed timeline is included in the transition out plan, with an emphasis on a smooth and successful handover to the new contractor. User training and the go-live event, which is scheduled for the end of July in 2023, are included in the plan's execution phase. The subsequent closeout phase includes several essential steps, such as documenting lessons learned, updating files and records, obtaining formal acceptance, archiving documents, and holding a meeting to conclude the project. The project closeout meeting is scheduled for the end of the month, and these activities will be carried out throughout the month of July. The Transition Project Manager, Developer Head, Quality Assurance Head, and Project Team Members will collaborate closely throughout the transition process to ensure a smooth handover and minimize disruptions to project operations. The project team strives to maintain the quality of project deliverables while adhering to this transition plan and timeline to ensure a successful and smooth handover to the new contractor.

In conclusion, the purpose of the transition out plan is to enable the project team to successfully complete the project while also ensuring that the client receives a system that is both fully functional and long-lasting.

<span id="transition-approach"></span>
==== 6.11.2. Transition Approach  ====

<blockquote>'''Overall Approach:'''

The approach for the Transition Out plan for Madonna’s web will be a phased transition approach since there is a need for continuity and minimal disruption to ongoing operations. This approach allows for a gradual and systematic transfer of knowledge, resources, and responsibility to the new team, minimizing the risk of downtime and service interruption.

The transition approach will include the following steps:
</blockquote>
# Communication Plan: Ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the transition plan, timelines, and expectations for the transition.
# Transition Planning: Developed in coordination with Madonna’s Staff, and it will include a detailed timeline of all activities that need to be completed during the transition.
# Knowledge Transfer: Occur through various means, such as documentation, instruction manuals, as-built documents, and formal training classes, to ensure that the Madonna’s staff has the necessary skills and knowledge to support the system.
# Staffing: During transition, the project team will scale down their staff to a minimum level required to support the knowledge transfer and transition activities.

<blockquote>'''Timeline:'''

The transition out plan for this project involves a comprehensive schedule of activities that are necessary to successfully transition from the incumbent contractor to the Madonna’s staff. The transition plan is broken down into two main phases, execution, and closeout.

The execution phase includes user training and mock testing are scheduled from July 26th to 10th of August. The closeout phase involves document lessons learned, updating files/records, gaining formal acceptance, archive files/documents, and project closeout meeting.

These activities will be conducted from 15th of August to 1st of September. The timeline provides a detailed schedule for each activity to ensure timely completion of all transition activities. The success of the transition plan will depend on the careful planning and execution of each activity as outlined in the timeline.

'''Assumptions:'''

The following assumptions will be made for the transition approach:
</blockquote>
* Madonna’s staff will be available onsite or via online meeting to participate in the transition and receive knowledge transfer.
* The project team will provide all necessary equipment for Madonna’s staff to support the system.
* The project team will provide all necessary documentation, training, and instruction manuals to Madonna’s staff to facilitate knowledge transfer.

<span id="workforce-transition"></span>
==== 6.11.4. Workforce Transition  ====

<blockquote>The overall transition out plan for Madonna's web project relies heavily on the workforce transition. To ensure a smooth and effective transition, the workforce plan must be carefully determined and communicated.

The Transition Project Manager will work closely with both the customer and the incoming contractors as part of the transition team to determine the most effective strategy for the workforce transition. Retaining current employees, facilitating their transfer to the new contractor, or hiring new employees are all possible approaches.

Throughout this process, it is essential to communicate clearly and effectively so that the workforce is informed of any changes promptly and with respect. The Transition Project Manager will collaborate closely with HR and management to ensure that every employee receives the necessary support during the transition and is well-informed about their options.

Moreover, fitting preparation or retraining projects will be executed to guarantee that the labor force is completely prepared to keep up with the conveyance of great administrations during and after the change period. To guarantee that the project will be finished on time and within budget, the workforce transition plan will be evaluated on a regular basis.
</blockquote>
<span id="workforce-execution-during-transition"></span>
==== 6.11.5. Workforce Execution During Transition  ====

<blockquote>Workforce Activities During the Transition There are a few important work activities that need to be done during the transition period of Madonna's web project:
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><blockquote><p>User Education: During this phase, training materials to teach users about the website are created and distributed. It is anticipated that the training sessions will last one week and will include both classroom and hands-on instruction.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Mock Exams: The new system will be launched during this phase for the team and staff to test thoroughly. Before making the system available to users, it aims to ensure that every function functions properly.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Documentation of the Learned Lessons: The important lessons learned throughout the project will be documented during this phase. This requires determining both areas in which the team performed admirably and those in which there are opportunities for improvement. The resulting document will be a useful tool for future projects and best practices adoption.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Changing Records and Files: During this phase, you are responsible for updating all relevant records and files to reflect the completion of the project. It might entail preserving documents or incorporating new information into agreements and contracts.</p></blockquote></li></ol>

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><blockquote><p>Acceptance in Writing: The customer's formal acceptance of the transition will be obtained during this phase, confirming its successful completion. The team will check to see that the customer is happy with the new system and that all deliverables have been met.</p></blockquote></li></ol>

<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><blockquote><p>Document and File Archiving: All project-related files and documents, including contracts, agreements, project plans, and other relevant materials, are archived during this phase.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Meeting to close the project: A meeting to conclude the project with all stakeholders is the culmination of the transition's final phase. This meeting is a chance to talk about the project in detail, pointing out the good points and the bad, and fixing any problems that still exist.</p></blockquote></li></ol>

<span id="subcontracts"></span>
==== 6.11.6. Subcontracts  ====

<blockquote>There are no existing contracts or subcontract agreements related to this project. Therefore, no transition of contracts or related agreements is required.
</blockquote>
<span id="property-transition"></span>
==== 6.11.7. Property Transition  ====

<span id="government-furnished-equipment-gfe"></span>
===== 6.11.7.1. Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)  =====

<blockquote>Since there is no involvement of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) in the Madonna’s Web project, this section of the transition plan is not applicable.
</blockquote>
<span id="incumbent-owned-equipment"></span>
===== 6.11.7.2. Incumbent Owned Equipment  =====

<blockquote>It is important to clearly identify the equipment that is owned by the incumbent and will remain with them. If there is any equipment that is needed to support the customer's applications and services, the plan should state whether the new contractor or customer has the option to purchase or use it. The plan should also include a timeline for the transfer of ownership and any necessary documentation, such as bills of sale or transfer of ownership agreements.

In the case of the Madonna’s Web project, if Madonna’s Garden Resort and Event Place can provide the necessary equipment upon transition, there may not be a need for the project team to transition the equipment to them. However, it is still important to clearly identify which equipment is incumbent-owned and which will be provided by Madonna’s Garden Resort and Events Place to ensure a smooth transition and avoid any potential conflicts or misunderstandings. The project team should work closely with Madonna’s Resort and Events Place to ensure that all necessary equipment is available and properly transferred.
</blockquote>
<span id="intellectual-property"></span>
===== 6.11.7.3. Intellectual Property  =====

<blockquote>Property Transition Intellectual Property (IP) It is essential to address the management of intellectual property (IP) during the transition process of the Madonna's web project to facilitate the seamless transfer of all pertinent documentation, information about suppliers and subcontractors, service agreements, and original designs or plans. Implementing non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) between the current contractor and the customer is one legal consideration that must be considered when handling intellectual property correctly. To guarantee proper intellectual property management throughout the transition, the following actions will be taken:
</blockquote>
# Finding the Right Intellectual Property:

* All project-related intellectual property, including design documents, patents, trademarks, copyrights, software code, proprietary data, and trade secrets, will be identified.
*# Assessment of Legally binding Arrangements:
* During the transition, compliance with existing contractual agreements regarding intellectual property ownership and transfer will be checked and evaluated.
*# New Contracts in Negotiation:

<ul>
<li><blockquote><p>The current contractor, the new contractor, and the customer will negotiate new agreements to clarify ownership and ensure the proper transfer of all intellectual property in the event of inconsistencies or gaps in the existing agreements.</p></blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Intellectual Property Security:</p></li></ol>
</li>
<li><blockquote><p>To safeguard all intellectual property throughout the transition period, stringent measures like non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and other legal safeguards will be put into place.</p></blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Intellectual Property Transfer:</p></li></ol>
</li>
<li><blockquote><p>Depending on the terms of the contracts in place, after the transition process is finished, the relevant intellectual property will either be given to the new contractor, the customer, or kept by the current contractor. If you follow these steps, you can rest assured that Madonna's web project's intellectual property will be transferred without a hitch and in safety.</p></blockquote></li></ul>

<span id="user-accounts-and-passwords"></span>
===== 6.11.7.4. User Accounts and Passwords  =====

<blockquote>In the progress plan for Madonna's Internet project, it is imperative to address the exchange of client records and passwords. This aspect of the property transition is outlined in the steps and considerations that follow:
</blockquote>
# User Accounts in Stock:

* Create an extensive inventory that includes all internal and external user accounts, including those of system administrators, third-party vendors, and end users. Determine which accounts are no longer required by the system or are inactive.
*# Keeping Your Passwords Safe:
* During the transition, reset or disable all user passwords to preserve security. Inform users to switch their passwords to a temporary one that was given to them prior to the change. The new contractor or system owner should then require all users to create new, secure passwords.
*# Table of User Accounts:
* Include a table in the transition plan that details the user accounts that will be disabled or transitioned. The username, the associated email address, the corresponding privileges, or access rights, and whether the account will be transitioned or disabled should be listed in the table. For the account transition process, provide any specific instructions.

<blockquote>In conclusion, a crucial component of Madonna's Web project's property transition plan is the transition of user accounts and passwords. A smooth and secure transition can be achieved by carrying out a comprehensive account inventory, implementing password security measures, and providing a user account table.
</blockquote>
<span id="knowledge-transfer"></span>
==== 6.11.8. Knowledge Transfer  ====

<blockquote>'''Documentation/Manuals:'''
</blockquote>
* The project team and Madonna’s owner will provide documentation and manuals to Madonna’s staff.
* The documentation will include a project overview, system architecture, functional requirements, technical specifications, and other relevant documentation to help Madonna’s staff understand the system and its workings.
* The manuals will provide step-by-step instructions on performing specific tasks related to the system.

<blockquote>'''Training:'''
</blockquote>
* Madonna’s staff will receive one-on-one training from the project team and Madonna’s owner to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the system and its processes.
* Madonna’s staff will also have access to online training materials and resources to further enhance their knowledge and skills related to the system.
* The project team will be responsible for cascading the information to Madonna’s staff, adapting to the fast-paced environment instead of scheduled classes.

<blockquote>To ensure a successful knowledge transfer, regular check-ins and meetings will be scheduled between the project team, Madonna’s owner, and Madonna’s staff. This will facilitate a smooth transfer of knowledge and address any questions or issues in a timely manner. Any updates or changes to the system will be documented and shared with the Madonna’s staff to ensure they have access to the most up-to-date information.

==== 6.11.10. Handover and Acceptance  ====

<blockquote>Initiating the handover and acceptance process will follow the completion of the transition plan, encompassing all necessary documentation and deliverables. Subsequently, the project team will arrange a formal meeting with the project sponsor and relevant stakeholders to conduct a thorough review of the transition plan and ensure the fulfillment of all requirements.

During the handover meeting, the project team will present the finalized transition plan, along with all the requisite documentation and deliverables, to the project sponsor and other pertinent stakeholders. These materials will be carefully examined, and any unresolved issues or concerns will be discussed in detail.

Upon resolving all outstanding matters, the project sponsor and stakeholders will endorse the formal acceptance document, serving as tangible evidence of the successful completion of the handover. The acceptance document will include a comprehensive checklist of all essential deliverables and documentation, accompanied by the signatures of all stakeholders who have duly reviewed and approved the materials.

Additionally, the handover and acceptance section will outline the procedure for addressing any remaining issues or concerns that may arise after the handover. This may involve following a formal dispute resolution process or implementing corrective actions to rectify identified deficiencies.

Overall, the handover and acceptance section within the contract transition out plan will provide a transparent and detailed roadmap for executing the handover process and ensuring the satisfaction of all stakeholders with the outcomes.
