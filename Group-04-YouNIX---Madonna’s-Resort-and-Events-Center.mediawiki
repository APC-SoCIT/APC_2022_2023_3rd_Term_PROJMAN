=Company Profile=
<p>This project is for the client namely Madonna’s Resort and Event Center, which is a newly opened resort in Malvar, Batangas. Currently, they are using Google Forms to be manually encoded by their staff and spreadsheets that they sometimes use whenever the form is inaccessible which sometimes causes conflicts in the reservation of facilities and dates. 
</p>
=Business Case=
==Executive Summary==
==Issue==
<p>Madonna’s Resort only uses Facebook page for online contact and promotion, pen & paper and excel sheets when people are booking or reserving on them. When the need arises for promoting their Facebook page, they will be required to pay for subscription, or their promotion will be limited. Another issue is during pen & paper, there are times that the paper is misplaced or forgotten to write down. </p>

==Anticipated Outcomes==
<p>The project anticipates a functional online reservation and booking website for the Madonna’s Resort by the end of June 2023. It will be implemented within the resort, making use of the website. The proposed system should include all the functionalities of online reservation and booking eliminating the use of pen & paper and excel sheets. 
</p>
==Recommendation==
<p>
As a solution to the issues listed, it is recommended that a website that is multi-functional with a focus on online reservation and booking should be produced. The project will alleviate the main pain points of their booking and reservations, as well their promotion of Madonna’s resort by having the website. This affects their issues and will improve the online interaction and booking & reservations performance as they have complete control of the website. 
</p>
==Justification==
<p>Shifting away from pen & paper and excel sheets would give a better user and staff experience for Madonna’s resort. The time that a customer will make a reservation on the website will be efficient and less time consuming as it is system automated and would only need to do fewer interactions for the customer to get them reserved in the resort. 

The cost of the project is low due to the project being a project-based learning which is the client, Madonna’s Resort, would only need to pay for their monthly subscription when they upload it online.

==Problem Definition==
<p> <b>Problem Statement</b></p>
<p>Madonna’s Resort and Events Center is a resort and events center which provides booking and reservation in their facilities, swimming in public or private pool, and having an event hall for company outing activities or organization activities. The resort is newly opened in Malvar, Batangas. They started creating the resort during the start of pandemic, way back 2020. Currently, they are using Google forms to be manually encoded by their staff and spreadsheets that they sometimes use whenever the form is inaccessible which sometimes causes conflicts in the reservation of facilities and date. </p>
<br><p>
    There is a difference between the reservation and booking. The reservation is for the entrance fee of the individual on the resort who wants to use the pool and event center, while bookings are for the cottages and rooms of the customer. 
</p>
<p><b>Organizational Impact</b></p>
<p>The implementation of the system will help improve the overall performance the Madonna’s resort staff since it will prevent more human errors and have their work more efficient when they are encoding the data of their customer during reservations and bookings. </p>

<p><b>Technology Migration</b></p>
<p>The system will be developed by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend development; For the backend development, Django with built-in SQL, and Python, are used. This programming language and framework are what the website is composed of. In terms of data migration, since Django has a built-in database, it will be easy to export the data as there is an added feature for the staff of Madonna’s. </p>

==Project Overview==
<p><b>Project Description</b></p>
<p>To address the issue of unnecessary dispatch and truck rolls, the project aims to develop a system which is a website that will help Madonna’s Resort on reservations, as well as blog and photo gallery. As an overview of these tools, reservations are done through filling out a form on the website and will redirect to a page that will produce a receipt which will then the customer can used to make a down payment on Gcash since it is included in the receipt. This will then be transferred to the database that which admin and staff of the resort whose logged on the website can check, confirm, edit, and remove the receipt depending on the circumstances. Logging in on the website is only exclusive for the admin and staff of the resort and there is no redirection for the login page on the home page; It is provided only via a link. Blog is where the admin and staff post details and advertisements for the resort. They can add, edit, and delete posts on the blog and have complete control with no limitations to what they can publish. Only the admin and staff of the resort can publish a post. The photo gallery is where the resort can post their latest pictures and are categorized so that ease of sorting can help both the resort and customer see what they need to look at. It is configured through their account on the website that they can add and edit, which is similar to blog but is purposed for photo gallery. <br>
<br>
Doing this project will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Madonna’s Resort by providing them a website that combines all they needed that helps them track their changes better and publish what they want as they have control with no limitations on the website. <p>

<p><b>Goals and Objectives</b></p>
<p>The project aims to improve the reservation and advertisement of the resort by providing an interactive and responsive website that can provide a reservation management system. 

 <br>
    For the team to achieve these, their specific objectives are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep track of reservations and booking data of customers in real-time using a single medium. </li>
  <li>Reduce cases of conflicts in schedules to 0. </li>
  <li>Reduce cases of unauthorized writing on the booking records by 70%. </li>
  <li>Compute sales with 100% accuracy. </li>
  <li>Generate monthly sales reports, sales per booking and reservation, and transactions reports. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Project Performance</b></p>
<p>To measure the performance of the proposed project about developing a website for the Madonna’s Resort and Events Center, the following measures can be considered: <p>
<ul>
  <li><b></b> </li>
  <li><b></b> </li>
  <li><b></b> .</li>
  <li><b></b></li>
  <li><b></b> </li>
  <li><b></b></li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p><b>Project Assumptions</b></p>
<p>Here are the preliminary assumptions to the proposed system:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The managing of the system, as well handling customer reservation is only accessible within the employees of Madonna’s resort and Events Center </li>
  <li>The developers who will work on this project are computer science students in Asia Pacific college thus the students are already knowledgeable and experienced in development and testing environment for the system. </li>
  <li>There is no cost in development of the project as it is project-based learning included in the curriculum of the school thus the only cost that will be needed will solely for the maintenance of the system once deployed. </li>
  <li>The Django framework that has been used in development has no cost and is an open-source framework which contributes to resolving the problem that Madonna’s Resort encounters. </li>
  <li>This project has full support of the project sponsor, Madonna’s Resort, and Asia Pacific College. Which means any necessary project approvals and permissions will be obtained promptly. </li>
</ol>

<p><b>Project Constraints</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Budget:</b> Available monetary resources that the team can use to make the system go online and be published in a cloud web services platform. </li>
  <li><b>Resources:</b> such as developers, for maintaining and improving the system.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Major Project Milestones</b></p>
<p>To guide the team’s progress in completing the project, the following milestones and deliverables for this project have been identified:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Look for a client during the subject, SNTSDEV, which results in finding Madonna’s Resort and Events center. </li>
  <li>Interviewed to collect ideas about the resort so that it would contribute to developing the system in alignment of what the client wanted. </li>
  <li>Identified the problem of the business so that the pain points would help the team to produce the system better. </li>
  <li>Conducted project pitch which are documentations, SWOT analysis, and a prototype to help the team visualizing the project and how to improve in alignment of the client’s problem. </li>
  <li>Develop the system during the subject, SCSPROJ, with the features resolving the problems that the client had on the platforms they are currently using. </li>
  <li>Found a website online hosting platform that the team and the client can use and complete the hand-off and close out. </li>
</ol>
==Strategic Alignment==
<p>By aligning the Madonna’s Web project with the overall strategic goals and objectives of Madonna’s Resort and Events Center, the business will be able to maximize the value of the project and ensure that it is contributing to the success of the business. </p>
<p><b>Madonna’s aims to have a website that helps in their difficulties in reservations and advertising. </b>
<br>
The project aligns with this goal by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the online interactions of the business and helping enhance through resolving the limitations they had when using their existing multiple platforms. </p>

<p><b>Madonna’s aims are to have more control and features that they can use to improve their online interactions. </b> 
<br>
The project aligns with these goals as admin and staff of the resort will have control on how they want to propagate and advertise the website.  
</p>

==Cost Benefit Analysis==
<p>The cost-benefit analysis will help determine the potential benefit of Madonna’s Web system in comparison to the cost incurred. The primary benefit of this project is the improvement of efficiency and accuracy in booking and reservations, computation of sales, and advertising. The system will allow for faster response times, leading to improved customer satisfaction and reduced operational costs. </p>

<p><b>Benefits </b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved admin and staff online interaction as they have control and no limitations to what they can do since the system has provided and resolved the need and lacking features than the multiple platforms they used. </li> 
  <li>Improved customer booking and reservations, as the system has this feature that is improved solely for business. </li>
  <li>Improved efficiency and effectiveness of Madonna’s resort resulting in better productivity and less human errors. </li>
  <li>Improved visibility into the work of the resort staff, enabling managers and owners to monitor the progress of the system and identify potential issues like human errors. </li>
  </ul>
<p><b>Cost </b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Development and implementation cost zero as it is a project-based learning and the framework used in developing the system is free. </li>
  <li>Maintenance cost less as the client only needed to provide the system a subscription fee for the chosen online cloud web hosting site for the project to be deployed online. </li>
</ul>

==Alternatives Analysis==
<p><b>Alternative 1: Do nothing (status quo)</b>
<br>
In this option, the business would continue to use the platform and tools to maintain reservation and advertisement. 
Pros: No upfront and disruption to existing platforms and tool. 
Cons: Potential for ongoing costs and difficulties on the platform and tools they used which would lead to conflict of reservation, difficulty in reserving and advertising, and computation of sales</p>

<p><b>Alternative 2: Creating a website through hiring of developers </b>
<br>
In this option, the business will create the website that will resolve the difficulties and limitations they had on the existing platform they are using. 

Pros: Improved efficiency and effectives, have more direct control and create into their liking. 

Cons: Possible increase cost due to the business needing to hire a team of professionals to create their website </p>

<p><b>Alternative 3: Use of website builders</b>
<br>
Multiple reasons for not selecting this option are that it is free but have limitations; It has multiple subscription tiers, and the maintenance cost is higher than creating or hiring developers; Lack of features even when subscribed which can be a disadvantage to the business if the feature, they want is lacking on the website builder. 
</p>

==Approvals==
<p> The project approval should come from the project sponsor – Micheal James Gnilo, the owner of Madonna’s Resort and Events Center. </p>


=Stakeholder Management Strategy=
==Introduction==
<p>The goal of the stakeholder management strategy for the project is to effectively engage and manage the expectations of all stakeholders throughout the project life cycle. This includes identifying and analyzing stakeholder needs and interests, developing a communication plan to keep stakeholders informed and engaged, and managing stakeholder expectations to ensure that the project delivers value and meets the needs of all stakeholders.</p>

<p>The Stakeholder Management Strategy for Madonna Resort’s Madonna Web Project will be used to identify and classify project stakeholders; determine stakeholder power, interest, and influence; and analyze the management approach and communication methodology for project stakeholders.  This will allow us to identify key influential stakeholders to solicit input for project planning and gain support as the project progresses.  This will benefit the project by minimizing the likelihood of encountering competing objectives and maximizing the resources required to complete the project.</p>
<br>
<p>Early identification and communication with stakeholders are imperative to ensure the success of Madonna’s Web Project by gaining support and input for the project.  Some stakeholders may have interests which may be positively or negatively affected by the Madonna’s Web Project.  By initiating early and frequent communication and stakeholder management, we can more effectively manage and balance these interests while accomplishing all project tasks. </p>

==Identify Stakeholders==
<p>Madonna’s Web Project Team will conduct a brainstorming session to identify stakeholders for the project.  The brainstorming session will include the primary project team and project sponsor.  The session will be broken down into two parts.  The first part will focus on internal stakeholders within Madonna’s Resort.  These stakeholders may include functional managers, operations personnel, finance personnel, warehouse, and material handlers, and any other Madonna’s Resort employee who will be affected by the Madonna’s Web project.  The second part of the session will focus on external stakeholders.  These may include suppliers, trial customers, partner organizations, or any other individuals who reside outside of Madonna’s Resort.</p>

<p>The following criteria will be used to determine if an individual will be included as a stakeholder: </p>
<ul>
   <li>Will the person or their organization be directly or indirectly affected by this project? </li>
   <li>Does the person or their organization hold a position from which they can influence the project? </li>
   <li>Does the person have an impact on the project’s resources (material, personnel, funding)? </li>
   <li>Does the person or their organization have any special skills or capabilities the project will require? </li>
   <li>Does the person potentially benefit from the project or are they able to resist this change? </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Any individual who meets one or more of the above criteria will be identified as a stakeholder.  Stakeholders from the same organization will be grouped to simplify communication and stakeholder management. </p>

==Key Stakeholders==
<p>As a follow on to Identify Stakeholders, the project team will identify key stakeholders who have the most influence on the project or who may be impacted the most by it.  These key stakeholders are those who also require the most communication and management which will be determined as stakeholders are analyzed.  Once identified, the Project Manager will develop a plan to obtain their feedback on the level of participation they desire, frequency and type of communication, and any concerns or conflicting interests they have.</p>
<p>Based on the feedback gathered by the project manager, the determination may be made to involve key stakeholders on steering committees, focus groups, gate reviews, or other project meetings or milestones.  Thorough communication with key stakeholders is necessary to ensure all concerns are identified and addressed and that resources for the project remain available.</p>


==Stakeholder Analysis==
<p>Once all Madonna’s Web Project stakeholders have been identified, the project team will categorize and analyze each stakeholder.  The purpose of this analysis is to determine the stakeholders’ level of power or influence, plan the management approach for each stakeholder, and to determine the appropriate levels of communication and participation each stakeholder will have on the project.   </p>
<p>The project team will categorize stakeholders based on their organization or department.  Once all stakeholders have been categorized, the project team will utilize a power/interest matrix to illustrate the potential impact each stakeholder may have on the project.  Based on this analysis the project team will also complete a stakeholder analysis matrix which illustrates the concerns, level of involvement, and management strategy for each stakeholder.</p>
<p>The table below will be used to establish stakeholders and their levels of power and interest for use on the power/interest chart as part of the stakeholder analysis. </p>

<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">
    <tr>
        <th>Key</th>

</table>

<p>Based on the power and interest analysis table above, stakeholders A, C, and D will require minimal management effort as they reside in the lower left quadrant of the matrix.  Stakeholder F, in the upper left quadrant, must be kept satisfied by ensuring concerns and questions are addressed adequately.  Stakeholder G, in the lower right quadrant, must be kept informed through frequent communication on project status and progress.  Stakeholders B and E, in the upper right quadrant, are key players and must be involved in all levels of project planning and change management.  Additionally, stakeholders B and E should be participatory members in all project status meetings, gate reviews, and ad hoc meetings as required. </p>
<p>The stakeholder analysis matrix will be used to capture stakeholder concerns, level of involvement, and management strategy based on the stakeholder analysis and power/interest matrix above.  The stakeholder analysis matrix will be reviewed and updated throughout the project’s duration to capture any new concerns or stakeholder management strategy efforts. </p>

==Work Breakdown Structure==
<p>The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a way of organizing a project by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts, and arranged in a hierarchy. The WBS is made up of multiple levels that provide increasingly detailed views of the project. The WBS Dictionary is a supplemental document that accompanies the WBS and provides comprehensive information about each component in the WBS, including details on the scope of work, deliverables, and responsibilities.<br>
<br>
The project team intends to utilize the WBS and WBS Dictionary to divide the project's scope into more manageable components, and to designate responsibility for each component. This approach will ensure that all aspects of the project are considered, and that team members understand their part in delivering the project. The WBS and WBS Dictionary will serve as a guide to track progress, address problems, and make certain that the project stays on course and within the scope. In general, the WBS and WBS Dictionary are crucial tools for managing the project scope and ensuring its successful completion.</p>

==Scope Verification==
<p>To ensure that the deliverables from the Apelo Dental Clinic System project meet the original scope, the project team will utilize a variety of methods for scope verification. These methods may include: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Quality checklist:</b> 
The project team will rely on checklists to ensure that each deliverable meets the required standards before proceeding. These checklists will contain detailed specifications for each deliverable, outlining the specific criteria that must be met for it to be considered acceptable.
</li>
  <li><b>Work performance measurements:</b>
By closely monitoring the development of each deliverable, the project team can ensure that they are staying on track and meeting their objectives. This proactive approach enables the team to catch any problems early on, minimizing the risk of delays or cost overruns and ensuring a successful outcome for the project.
</li>
  <li><b>Scope baseline:</b>
It is crucial for the project team to maintain a scope baseline, which captures the project's original scope. Any modifications to the scope must be formally documented and approved before they are implemented. The scope baseline serves as a reference point to ensure that the final deliverables align with the initial project scope.
</li>
  <li><b>Formal acceptance:</b> 
When a project team completes a deliverable, it is crucial to get formal acceptance from the project sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders. This helps ensure that everyone's expectations are being met and allows for any necessary adjustments to be made promptly, avoiding potential delays and misunderstandings down the line.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it is important that the project team maintains consistent communication and collaboration with the customer and other stakeholders throughout the project to ensure that the deliverables meet the original scope and are formally accepted. </p>

==Scope Control==
<p>As part of the project management process, the project's scope must be carefully controlled to ensure that it remains aligned with the original project objectives. The Project Manager will lead the effort to monitor and evaluate the project's deliverables and progress against the Project Scope Statement. Any deviations from the scope will be thoroughly examined and assessed to determine if changes are necessary. If changes are required, the established scope change process will be followed, with proper documentation and approval procedures in place. The project team and stakeholders will work closely with the Project Manager to ensure that the scope remains within the defined boundaries. Regular reviews will be conducted to assess progress and identify any areas where scope changes may be necessary. The Project Manager will be responsible for communicating any scope changes to all affected parties, ensuring that everyone is aware of any potential impact on the project's timeline or budget.<br>
<br>
The scope control process for the Apelo Dental Clinic System project will involve the following steps in making changes to the scope baseline: </p>
<ol>
  <li>A scope change request will be initiated by any stakeholder or team member who identifies a need for a change to the scope.</li>
  <li>The Project Manager and the Project Sponsor will evaluate the effect of the proposed modifications on the project's schedule, budget, and resources by reviewing the scope change request.</li>
  <li>The Project Manager has the authority to approve or reject change requests that are considered to have minimal impact or significant impact. However, if the change request is classified as low impact and the Project Manager approves or denies it, the Project Sponsor has the option to review and overturn their decision.</li>
  <li>Assuming the request gets approved, the Project Manager will devise a course of action to implement the change, amend the scope baseline, and inform all the pertinent stakeholders about the change.</li>
  <li>Assuming the request gets approved, the Project Manager will devise a course of action to implement the change, amend the scope baseline, and inform all the pertinent stakeholders about the change.</li>
</ol>
<p>To guarantee the project remains within budget and on schedule, it's crucial to establish a structured protocol for modifying the scope baseline. Any modifications to the scope must be scrutinized and authorized with care to prevent scope creep and maintain project progress.</p>


=Cost Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Cost Management Plan for Apelo Dental Clinic System (ADENICSY) project is designed to ensure that all costs associated with the project are effectively managed throughout its lifecycle. The plan outlines the format and standards by which the project costs will be measured, reported, and controlled.

<br><br>Cost management responsibilities:

<ul>
  <li>The Project Manager will be responsible for overall cost management of the project and will be the primary point of contact for all cost-related issues.</li>
  <li>The Finance Team will be responsible for monitoring project costs and ensuring that they are within the approved budget.</li>
</ul>

Cost change approval:
<ul>
  <li>All cost changes must be approved by the Project Manager before they are implemented.</li>
  <li>If the cost change exceeds 10% of the total project budget, it must be approved by the Project Sponsor before it can be implemented.</li>
</ul>

Cost measurement and reporting:
<ul>
  <li>Costs will be measured and reported on a monthly basis, using a cost performance index (CPI) and a schedule performance index (SPI).</li>
  <li>Reports will be presented to the Project Sponsor on a monthly basis.</li>
</ul>

Budget format and standards:
<ul>
  <li>The budget will be presented in a clear and concise format, using a spreadsheet format such as Excel.</li>
  <li>The budget will be broken down into individual line items, with detailed cost estimates for each item.</li>
  <li>The budget will be updated on a monthly basis, with any changes clearly highlighted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the Cost Management Plan for ADENICSY project is designed to ensure that all costs associated with the project are effectively managed and controlled, so that the project can be completed within the approved budget. This will help ensure that the project is completed successfully and on time.

==Cost Management Approach==
<p>The cost management approach for the dispatch directory system project will be based on the following principles:
</p>
<br>
<p>
a.	Clear definition of costs:
-	The project team will work closely with stakeholders to clearly define and document the costs associated with the project, including labor, materials, equipment, and other expenses.
<br>
<br>
b.	Budget development and tracking:
-	A detailed project budget will be developed and regularly updated throughout the project, with costs tracked and reported in real time.
<br>
<br>
c.	Cost estimates:
-	The project team will use a variety of cost estimation techniques to ensure that the project budget is accurate and realistic.
<br>
<br>
d.	Cost variance analysis:
-	The project team will closely monitor costs throughout the project and perform variance analysis to identify and address any cost overruns or savings.
<br>
<br>
e.	Cost management roles and responsibilities:
-	Clear roles and responsibilities for cost management will be defined and communicated to all project team members.
<br>
<br>
f.	Approval process for changes:
-	A formal process for approving changes to the project or its budget will be established and implemented.
<br>
<br>
g.	Reporting and communication:
-	Regular cost reports will be prepared and shared with stakeholders, including the project sponsor, project team, and management.
</p>

<p>By following these principles and practices, the project team will be able to effectively manage costs and ensure that the project stays on budget.</p>

==Measuring Project Cost==
<p>The Cost Management Plan for ADENICSY project will include a detailed approach for measuring project costs using Earned Value Management (EVM). This will involve capturing and reporting on various Earned Value metrics, such as:</p>

<p>
1. Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) - This measures the budgeted costs of the work that was planned to be completed at a specific point in time.
</p>

<p>
Example:<br>

To calculate the BCWS or Planned Value, we need to multiply the total labor cost of the TESTING WBS by its percentage of completion:<br>

BCWS = Total labor cost of TESTING WBS x Percentage of completion<br>
= (PHP 300,000) x 33.71%<br>
= PHP 101,130<br><br>

Therefore, the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) for the TESTING WBS is PHP 101,130.
<p>

<p>
2. Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) - This measures the budgeted costs of the work that has actually been completed at a specific point in time.
</p>

<p>
Example:<br>

To calculate the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV), we need to know the percentage of work completed for each task or WBS element. Assuming that the percentage of completion for each of the Testing<br>
Phase tasks are as follows:
<br>

<ul>
<li>Week 26: Testing Phase 1 - 100%</li>
<li>Week 27: Testing Phase 2 - 75%</li>
<li>Week 28: Testing Phase 3 - 50%</li>
<li>Week 29: Testing Phase 4 - 25%</li>
</ul>

Then, we can calculate the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) as follows:<br><br>
EV = BCWS x % of work completed<br>
EV = (₱300,000 x 33.71%) + (₱75,000 x 8.43% x 0.75) + (₱75,000 x 8.43% x 0.50) + (₱75,000 x 8.43% x 0.25)<br>
EV = ₱101,130 + ₱4,732.50 + ₱3,155 + ₱1,577.50<br>
EV = ₱110,595<br><br>

Therefore, the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) is ₱110,595.
<p>

<p>
3. Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) - This measures the actual costs incurred for the work that has been completed at a specific point in time.<br>
Example:<br>
Assuming that the Actual Cost for the TESTING WBS is PHP 120,000, then:<br>

AC = PHP 120,000<br><br>

Therefore, the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) is <br>
PHP 120,000.<br><br>

These metrics will be used to perform cost variance analysis (CV), schedule performance index (SPI), and cost performance index (CPI) to measure the project's cost performance over time.<br><br>
To assist in capturing these metrics, the project team will use project management software that is capable of tracking and reporting on EVM metrics. This software will also be used to forecast future project costs, and to review cost performance over time, across work packages or schedule activities.

<ol>
<li>Cost Variance (CV) measures the difference between the actual cost and the planned cost of the project. It is calculated by subtracting the actual cost from the planned cost. A negative CV indicates that the project is over budget, while a positive CV indicates that the project is under budget.<br>

Example:<br><br>

To compute the Cost Variance (CV), we need to subtract the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) from the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV). From the previous example, the BCWP or EV is ₱110,595, and the ACWP or AC is ₱120,000.<br><br>

CV = EV - AC<br>
CV = ₱110,595 - ₱120,000<br>
CV = -₱9,405<br><br>

Therefore, the Cost Variance (CV) for the Testing WBS is -₱9,405. A negative CV means that the project is over budget.<br>
</li>
<li>
Schedule Performance Index (SPI) measures the project's schedule performance by comparing the planned schedule to the actual schedule. This index is calculated as the ratio of the BCWP to the BCWS. It is calculated by dividing the earned value by the planned value. A value of 1 indicates that the project is on schedule, while a value less than 1 indicates that the project is behind schedule, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the project is ahead of schedule.<br><br>

Example:<br>

From the previous computations, we have:<br>

Earned Value (EV) = ₱110,595<br>
Planned Value (PV) = ₱101,130<br>
Plugging these values into the formula, we get:<br><br>

SPI = EV / PV<br>
SPI = ₱110,595 / ₱101,130<br>
SPI = 1.093<br><br>

Therefore, the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is 1.093. This indicates that the project is ahead of schedule, as the SPI is greater than 1.<br>
</li>
<li>
Cost Performance Index (CPI) measures the project's cost performance by comparing the actual cost to the planned cost. This index is calculated as the ratio of the BCWP to the ACWP. It is calculated by dividing the earned value by the actual cost. A value of 1 indicates that the project is on budget, while a value less than 1 indicates that the project is over budget, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the project is under budget.<br><br>

Example:<br>
To calculate the Cost Performance Index (CPI), we need to use the following formula:<br>

CPI = EV / AC<br>
where:<br>
EV = Earned Value (BCWP) <br>
AC = Actual Cost (ACWP)<br>

From the previous computations, we have:<br>
EV = ₱110,595<br>
AC = ₱120,000<br><br>

CPI = EV / AC<br>
CPI = ₱110,595 / ₱120,000<br>
CPI = 0.9216<br><br>

Therefore, the Cost Performance Index (CPI) is 0.9216. This means that for every one peso spent, the project has earned only 0.92 pesos of value. This indicates that the project is behind budget and may need to take corrective actions to bring the costs in line with the planned budget.<br><br>

In summary, the Cost Management Plan will ensure that the project costs are effectively managed and controlled throughout the project’s lifecycle by using Earned Value Management metrics, schedule performance index, and cost performance index. These metrics will help the team to identify the areas where the project is underperforming and take corrective actions to bring the project back on track.<br>
</li>
</ol>

=Time Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Schedule Management Plan is crucial because it provides direction and information in this area and specifies how the project's schedule will be handled throughout the entire project. After evaluating, managing, and prioritizing all time-related schedule alterations, the schedule management plan specifies strategies and tactics and distributes them.</p>

==Schedule Management Approach==
<p>The project team and the resources assigned to it will cautiously work on the initial schedule once it has been produced in order to prevent the project's schedule from being in the critical path. The proposed work package task, the length of the activities, and the project timeline require the approval of the project team and assets. Once this has been completed, the project adviser will check, approve, and baseline the schedule.</p>
<br>
<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">

<br>
<p>When such changes are made, the plans and baselines will be updated. Furthermore, the same are shown as outputs. The scheduling approach, method of evaluation, tools, management, and control of the schedule will all be impacted by the development strategy.</p>
<br>
<p>The following are the roles and responsibilities involved in developing a schedule:</p>

           </ul>
        </td>
     </tr>
</table>

==Schedule Control==
<p>For the duration of the project, the schedule must be precisely and effectively managed. Meetings, schedules, project updates, and even changes to the project schedule go through the project manager, who is also responsible for managing them. The project manager will also be responsible for informing and keeping the project client informed of the project's status.</p>
<br>
<p>The project team, on the other hand, is required to attend meetings for any schedule updates provided and work on any timetable adjustments that would be made. The percentage of completion must be presented to the project team for discussion by project team members who also complete a task.</p>

==Schedule Changes and Thresholds==
<p>When the project team creates the schedule, the project sponsor must specify a deadline for the project to be finished or operational. This is essential because it enables the project sponsor to align the objectives and expectations of the project client with the project at hand. One of the factors that could affect the changes in schedule is poor schedule management, which requires an extension or change in the project plan. If there are any circumstances that might potentially affect the timetable and go beyond the limits specified by the project sponsor, the project manager should submit a schedule change request and it should be approved by the project sponsor before the schedule change is made.</p>
<br>
<p>If any of the following apply, a schedule change request must be submitted to the project stakeholder for approval, if not, then submission is made for approval to the project manager: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The suggested change is to limit the length of deliverables of a given Sprint Backlog during the project's development phase, to make it obvious that adding something to the duration does not indicate extending the work across the full duration.</li>
    <li>Changes to the scope statement must be taken into consideration in order to prevent conflicts during the project's documentation phase. The project team must compile every mistake in the document before expanding the work packages by 5% or more to reflect the changes in all the documentation.</li>
    <li>A different way to implement the changes is to either cut or extend the project's overall timetable by 10% or more.</li>
</ul>

==Scope Change==
<p>If a project problem arises that requires a substantial change in the project scope, it is best to propose a change. It is necessary to use prudence during the process of suggesting and evaluating the project's scope adjustment. Any project team member or project client may ask to change the project's scope. All change requests must be submitted in the form of a project change request document to the project advisor. Following that, the project manager will go over the requested change to the project's scope. The project adviser will either reject the request for change if it does not fit in with the project's goals or schedule, a meeting with the project client and project team to discuss it and determine its impact. Following initial approval from the project client and project adviser, the project manager will communicate the scope change to the entire project team. In result of that, the team members will amend any applicable paperwork, deliverables, and product backlogs. </p>

=Work Breakdown Structure=

==Introduction==
<p>The Apelo Dental Clinic System has the main goal to lessen the waiting time of the patients through queueing management, digitalization of patient’s dental records, and automating several manual processes to improve the clinic’s performance. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for Apelo Dental Clinic System outlines the various work packages that must be accomplished to deliver a functional and user-friendly e-commerce web application. The WBS presents the project scope and helps in defining the deliverables that must be accomplished to meet the project objectives. This document will provide an overview of the WBS layout for Apelo Dental Clinic System.</p>
<br>
<p>The WBS is organized into five major phases, which include project planning, analysis and design, development, documentation, and development II. Each phase is further broken down into several sub-phases or work packages, which are numbered for easy reference. The WBS has been designed to accommodate the key stakeholders, including the project owner, Doctor Denroe Apelo. Doctor Apelo will have the opportunity to review the WBS to ensure that the project goals are being met, and any adjustments can be made before the project progresses too far.</p>
<br>
<p>Overall, the WBS for Apelo Dental Clinic System provides a comprehensive view of the tasks needed to deliver a fully-functional e-commerce web application. It is an essential tool that helps the project team in tracking and monitoring the progress of the project, ensuring that it is delivered on time and to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.</p>
<br>

==Outline View==
<p>The outline view for the work breakdown structure (WBS) of Apelo Dental Clinic System provides a straightforward and clear layout that is easy to understand. This layout is particularly useful during the development phase of the project as it enables the project team to make changes quickly and efficiently. The outline view displays the hierarchical structure of the WBS, which allows the project team to easily see the various levels of the project and how they relate to one another. With this view, the team can easily identify the major deliverables of the project and the sub-deliverables that contribute to the completion of each major deliverable. This helps ensure that the project team stays on track and is able to complete the project within the established timeline.</p>

==Glossary of Terms==
<p><strong>Scrum</strong> – is a process encourages practitioners to work with what they have and continually evaluate what is working and what is not working. Communication, which is an important part of the process, is carried out through meetings, called Events. Sprint Planning Meeting - a sprint refers to the time frame in which work must be completed, and it's often 30 days. Everyone participates in setting the goals, and at the end, at least one increment -- a usable piece of software -- should be produced.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint Review</strong> - this is the time to show off the increment. Sprint Retrospective - is a meeting that's held after a Sprint ends. During this meeting, everyone reflects on the Sprint process. A team-building exercise may also be offered. An important goal of a Sprint Retrospective is continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint backlog</strong> - is a list of tasks that must be completed before selected product backlog items can be delivered. These are divided in to time-based user stories.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud integration</strong> - is the process of configuring multiple application programs to share data in the cloud. In a network that incorporates cloud integration, diverse applications communicate either directly or through third-party software.</p>
<p><strong>Risk management</strong> - is the process of identifying, assessing and controlling threats to an organization's capital and earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Project Charter</strong> - is a formal, typically short document that describes your project in its entirety including what the objectives are, how it will be carried out, and who the stakeholders are.</p>
<p>Level of Effort:       Level of Effort (LOE) is how much work is required to complete a task.</p>
<p>WBS Code:              A unique identifier assigned to each element in a Work Breakdown Structure for designating the elements hierarchical location within the WBS.</p>
<p>Work Package:         A Work Package is a deliverable or work component at the lowest level of its WBS branch.</p>
<p>WBS Component:    A component of a WBS which is located at any level.  It can be a Work Package or a WBS Element as there's no restriction on what a WBS Component is.</p>
<p>WBS Element:         A WBS Element is a single WBS component and its associated attributes located anywhere within a WBS.  A WBS Element can contain work, or it can contain other WBS Elements or Work Packages.</p>
