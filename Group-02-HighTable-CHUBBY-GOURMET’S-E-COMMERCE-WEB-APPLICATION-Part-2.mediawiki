<h1>Chubby Gourmet E-Commerce Web Application</h1>

=Schedule Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project is a strategic initiative that seeks to provide a robust platform for food enthusiasts to explore and purchase food items online and to help the business solve its business needs. To achieve the project's objectives, effective management practices, including proper planning, execution, and control, are essential. </p>
<p>Schedule management is a critical component of project management, which ensures that the project is delivered within the agreed timeline and budget. A well-crafted schedule provides a roadmap for the project team, enabling them to prioritize resources and tasks effectively. </p>
<p>This Schedule Management Plan for the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project outlines the approach to managing the project schedule, including schedule control, changes, and thresholds, and scope changes. This serves as a reference document that provides a framework for the project team to adhere to the agreed-upon schedule management process. </p>

==Schedule Management Approach==
<p>The schedule management approach outlines the general framework for creating and managing the project schedule for the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application. The approach includes the scheduling tool/format, schedule milestones, and schedule development roles and responsibilities. </p>

<p><strong>Scheduling Tool/Format </strong>
<br>
ProjectLibre will be used as the primary scheduling tool for the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project. This tool enables the creation of project schedules, including activity names, durations, predecessors, and resource names. ProjectLibre is a robust scheduling tool that provides features such as Gantt charts, enabling the project team to create and manage the project schedule effectively. Moreover, it will also be used to track and schedule milestones. Milestones are essential components of the project schedule as they indicate significant project achievements and provide a basis for tracking progress. The Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project will have several milestones, including the completion of the project planning phase, completion of the design phase, completion of the development phase, and project delivery. </p>

<p><strong>Schedule Development Roles and Responsibilities </strong>
<br>
The success of the project schedule depends on the project team's collaboration and communication. The roles and responsibilities for schedule development include the project manager, project team, project sponsor, and project stakeholders.  </p>

<p>Project Manager 
<br>
The project manager is responsible for overseeing the project schedule's development and ensuring that it aligns with the project objectives.  </p>
<p>Project Team 
<br>
The project team is responsible for providing input on task durations, dependencies, and resource requirements.  </p>
<p>Project Sponsor 
<br>
The project sponsor provides guidance and support throughout the project.</p>
<p>Project Stakeholders 
<br>
The project stakeholders provide input on the project schedule's development and ensure that it aligns with their requirements. </p>

==Schedule Control==
<p>The schedule control section defines how the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project's schedule will be managed throughout its duration. This includes the frequency of updates, schedule reviews, communicating the schedule and progress, and roles and responsibilities related to schedule control. </p>
<p><strong>Frequency of Updates and Schedule Reviews </strong>
<br>
The project schedule will be updated regularly to reflect progress made, changes in project scope or requirements, and other factors that may impact the project schedule. The project team will meet weekly to review and update the project schedule, ensuring that it aligns with the project objectives and timelines. However, any changes to the project schedule will be communicated promptly to all stakeholders, including the project sponsor and project stakeholders. </p>
<p><strong>Roles and Responsibilities </strong>
<br>
The success of schedule control depends on clearly defined roles and responsibilities.  </p>
<p>Project Manager 
<br>
The project manager is responsible for overseeing the project schedule's development, ensuring that it aligns with the project objectives and timelines, and managing any changes to the project schedule.  </p>
<p>Project Team 
<br>
The project team is responsible for providing input on task durations, predecessors, and resource requirements, and ensuring that tasks are completed on time.  </p>
<p>Project Sponsor 
<br>
The project sponsor provides guidance and support throughout the project, ensuring that the project stays on track and that any issues are addressed promptly.</p>
<p>Project Stakeholders 
<br>
The project stakeholders provide input on the project schedule's development, ensuring that it aligns with their requirements and expectations. </p>

==Schedule Changes and Thresholds==
<p>The schedule changes and thresholds section of the Schedule Management Plan for the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project outlines the process for managing schedule changes and sets the boundaries for changes to the project schedule. The section covers the approval process for schedule changes and the threshold for significant schedule changes. </p>
<p><strong>Schedule Change Request </strong>
<br>
The project sponsor will establish the schedule parameters within which the project is expected to operate. Any event that may potentially cause a schedule change exceeding these boundaries must have a schedule change request submitted for approval. The change request will identify the reason for the change, the impact on the project schedule, and any associated risks. The project manager will be responsible for submitting the schedule change request to the project sponsor for approval. </p>
<p><strong>Schedule Change Approval </strong>
<br>
The project sponsor will review and approve schedule change requests based on the established criteria. The project sponsor will consider the reason for the change, the impact on the project schedule, and any associated risks when making their decision. If the schedule change is approved, the project manager will update the project schedule and communicate the changes to the project team, stakeholders, and other relevant parties. </p>
<p><strong>Schedule Change Threshold </strong>
<br>
For the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project, a change threshold of 10% will be used. This means that any schedule change that impacts the project schedule by more than 10% must be approved by the project sponsor before the change can be implemented. This threshold will help to ensure that significant schedule changes are carefully considered and that the project remains on track. </p>

==Scope Change==
<p>The scope change section of the Schedule Management Plan for the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project outlines the process for managing scope changes and the impact on the project schedule. The section covers the process for evaluating the impact of scope changes and the steps for re-baselining the schedule if necessary. </p>
<p><strong>Scope Change Evaluation </strong>
<br>
Approved changes to the project's scope may result in the need to re-baseline the project schedule. These scope changes may include new deliverables or requirements that were not previously considered as part of the original schedule's development. When a scope change is proposed, the project manager and team must evaluate the impact of the change on the project schedule, resources, and budget. The project team will consider the impact on the schedule, identify any critical path changes, and adjust the schedule as needed. </p>
<p><strong>Re-Baselining the Schedule </strong>
<br>
If the evaluation indicates that the scope change will have a significant impact on the project schedule, the project manager will initiate the re-baselining process. This process includes updating the project schedule with the approved changes and obtaining approval from the project sponsor. The project manager will work with the project team to update the schedule and ensure that any changes are communicated to stakeholders and other relevant parties. </p>
<p><strong>Scope Change Approval </strong>
<br>
The project sponsor will review and approve scope changes based on the established criteria. The project sponsor will consider the impact on the project schedule, resources, and budget when making their decision. If the scope change is approved, the project manager will update the project schedule, obtain the necessary approvals, and communicate the changes to the project team and stakeholders. </p>

=Change Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Chubby Gourmet’s E-Commerce Web Application was created for the group’s chosen client which is Ms. Priscilla Mariano in order to help solve certain problems found within her current  
system of her local food business. Everyone involved in the development of the project must request changes to the group HighTable in accordance with this Change Management Plan and all requests and submissions will follow the process detailed herein. </p>

==Change Control Board==
<p>The Change Control Board (CCB) is the approval authority for all proposed change requests pertaining to the IS Project. The purpose of the CCB is to review all change requests, determine their impacts on the project risk, scope, cost, and schedule, and to approve or deny each change request. The following chart provides a list of the CCB members for the IS Project: 
</p>
<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">
	<tr>
		<td bgcolor="lightblue"><p style="text-align:center;">NAME</p></td>
<td bgcolor="lightblue"><p style="text-align:center;">POSITION</p></td>

<td><p style="text-align:center;">Scrum Master</p></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>As change requests are submitted to the IS Project Manager by the project team/stakeholders, the Project Manager will log the requests in the change log and the CCB will convene every other Friday to review all change requests. For a change request to be approved, all CCB members must vote in favor. In the event more information is needed for a particular change request, the request will be deferred and sent back to the requestor for more information or clarification. If a change is deemed critical, an ad hoc CCB meeting can be called in order to review the change prior to the next scheduled bi-weekly CCB meeting. 
</p>

=Communications Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Communications Management Plan document tackles Chubby Gourmet’s E-Commerce Web Application’s communication strategy and protocols that both HighTable and the stakeholder can use. The plan will be answering the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>The plan outlines types of information that will be communicated, such as project updates, progress reports, risks, and issues. It will also include the amount of detail and format of the information (Whether it be communicated verbally or through written means) </li>
<li>The plan outlines the methods of communication that will be utilized, such as meetings, or email, telephone.  </li>
<li>The plan outlines the frequency of project communications, both formal and informal methods. </li>
<li>The plan defines the roles and responsibilities of team members and stakeholders in terms of communication; this also includes who is responsible for distributing project information. </li>
<li>The plan outlines the communication needs of all stakeholders and how they will be met.  </li>
<li>The plan outlines the resources needed for communication (Such as budget and personnel) to have free flowing communication amongst all parties. </li>
<li>The plan outlines the protocols for exchanging sensitive or confidential information and includes who must authorize the release of such information.  </li>
<li>The plan defines a process for managing changes in the communication process. This will include how changes will be proposed, reviewed, and approved. This ensures that all stakeholders are aware of any changes and that the communication process remains consistent throughout the project. </li>
<li>The plan outlines the flow of communication within the production of the project. This also includes how information is exchanged between team members, the stakeholder, and other individuals involved in the development of the project. This helps to ensure that everyone involved in the Chubby Gourmet’s E-Commerce Web Application project is informed and that the information is shared in a timely manner.  </li>
<li>The plan discusses any constraints that may affect the project communications (E.g. legal or regulatory requirements) and outlines how these constraints will be addressed.  </li>
<li>The plan outlines any standard templates, formats, or documents that will be used for communicating project information (E.g. progress report, minutes of the meeting). </li>
<li>The plan includes an escalation process for resolving any communication-based conflicts or issues that may arise during the project.</li>  
</ul>



==Communications Management Approach==
<p>In this portion of the paper, it will be tackling how HighTable intends to manage their communications on the project. The group will approach this with a proactive and practical way of communicating with one another. </p>
<p>By being proactive, this allows the group to have a selfless attitude as the principle allows them to avoid small difficulties that may build up in the future. All members should have a proactive mindset as it allows everyone to have a deep understanding of what is needed and what actions can be taken to accomplish them.  </p>
<p>By being practical, this allows the group to be concise and efficient with how they progress throughout the development of the project. Analyzing and narrowing down the needed details, information, and data can ensure that everyone involved is getting the important points. Taking into consideration of how the status of the project and how the status of each member is, can help determine when and how to communicate the needs for one another. </p>



==Communications Management Constraints==
<p>The Communications Management Constraints for Chubby Gourmet’s E-Commerce Web Application will be identifying the constraints, limitations, and boundaries that may leave an impact or hinder the project’s development. It is important to address these constraints as it will serve as an outline of what the team’s limits are in terms of information and it can help find a way to mitigate potential roadblocks along the way. </p>
<p>This portion of the paper will discuss an overview of key constraints to take note of, and these may include communication processes such as internal and external factors, technological limitations, and regulatory requirements. </p>
<p>The Communications Management Constraints of the project are as follows: </p>

<ol>
<li>Limited budget for communication tools and resources: The project has a limited budget for communication tools and resources, so the usage of provided communication applications (E.g. Microsoft Teams meeting) will be mainly used. </li>
 
<li>Limited access to the stakeholder: The stakeholder may have limitations upon meeting physically as they are assigned to farther locations (specifically outside of NCR). </li>
 
<li>Limited availability of team members: The team members may be preoccupied with other commitments or responsibilities in their own times, which may limit their availability for communication.  </li>
 
 
<li>Confidentiality: Certain information related to the project may be confidential and require special handling and communication protocols (E.g. Addresses, Contact information, Account Information, and etc.).  </li>
 
 
<li>Technical difficulties: Technical difficulties may hinder communications as times may be unavoidable depending on the situation.  </li>
 
<li>Time constraints: The project can be restricting in time due to the needed deliverable dates assigned by either the team or the stakeholder. </li>
</ol>

==Communication Methods and Technologies==
<p>The Chubby Gourmet’s E-Commerce Web Application project needs a thorough understanding of what communication models and technologies are available to them, in order to effectively choose which method benefits all. Taking into consideration the different capabilities and limitations of each communication method and technology, will ensure that all individuals receive the necessary information they need. This portion of the document will determine the most effective methods for delivering project updates, progress reports, risks, and issues, and any other relevant information. </p>
<p>It is also important to consider the cost and feasibility of using different technologies, as well as any security or privacy related issues that may occur. By carefully considering all possibilities available to the team, this will ensure that all information will be received to everyone involved efficiently and safely. </p>
<p>These are the following considerations that HighTable will factor in for the communication methods: </p>

<ol>
<li>Location of the Stakeholder 
Since Ms. Mariano is stationed in Laguna and cannot hold a physical meeting and prefers a purely online way of communicating, the technology used to contact her must suit their current technology without sacrificing any security measures as much as possible. </li>
 
<li>The Type of Information dealt with 
Depending on how crucial or confidential the information is, the mode of communication must be considered depending on the type of information that is being handled. </li>
 
<li>Size and Complexity of the Project  
Considering how Chubby Gourmet is a micro-enterprise, the need for web portals and large-scale project management applications would not be a priority. </li>
 
<li>Level of technical expertise 
The client may not be too well versed in the field of technology. Keeping a simple and straight to the point communication will be most effective in this scenario. </li>
</ol>

<p>With all of these factors in mind, HighTable will take into consideration on how to approach the stakeholder with the combination of all of these factors in the most effective and efficient way as possible. </p>

==Guidelines for Meeting==
<p>In order to ensure an effective flow of information that is met with everyone involved, HighTable will be holding meetings that are productive, efficient, and effective. To do so, it is important to establish clear guidelines for the said meetings.

<p>Project Team Members: Responsible for providing support, knowledge, and expertise related to the system. They collaborate closely with the TPM, developers, and other team members to facilitate a smooth transition of knowledge and expertise. </p>

==Workforce Execution During Transition==
<p>During the transition phase of the Chubby Gourmet project, several crucial tasks will need to be completed to ensure a smooth handover. These tasks include: </p>
<ul>
<li>User Training: Develop and deliver training materials to educate users about the new system. Conduct training sessions that combine classroom instruction and hands-on practice to familiarize users with the system's functionalities. </li>
 
<li>System Launch: Ensure all necessary systems are in place and functioning properly before making the new system available to users. Conduct final system tests and verify the accurate migration of data to ensure a seamless transition. </li>
 
<li>Lessons Learned Documentation: Document the insights gained throughout the project, highlighting areas of success and areas for improvement. This document will serve as a valuable resource for future projects, promoting the adoption of best practices. </li>
 
<li>Updating Files/Records: Update relevant files and records to reflect the project's completion. This may involve archiving specific documents or updating contracts and agreements with updated information. </li>
 
<li>Formal Acceptance: Obtain formal acceptance from the client, indicating successful completion of the transition. Ensure all deliverables have been met and address any outstanding concerns to ensure client satisfaction. </li>
 
<li>Archiving Files/Documents: Archive all project-related files and documents, including contracts, agreements, project plans, and other pertinent materials. </li>
 
<li>Project Closeout Meeting: Conduct a project closeout meeting with all stakeholders to review the project's overall performance, acknowledge successes, identify areas for improvement, and address any remaining issues. </li>
 
</ul>

==Subcontracts==
<p>Additionally, since there are no existing contracts or subcontract agreements associated with the Chubby Gourmet project, there is no need for a transition or transfer of such contracts or agreements. </p>


==Property Transition==
===Incumbent Owned Equipment===
<p>As part of the transition plan for the Chubby Gourmet project, it is essential to address the transfer of user accounts and passwords. The following outlines the steps and considerations for this particular aspect of the transition: </p>
<ul>
<li>User Account Inventory: 
• Create a comprehensive inventory that lists all user accounts and their associated privileges. This inventory should include internal and external users, such as administrators, customers, and other relevant stakeholders. Identify any inactive or unnecessary accounts that can be excluded from the transition. </li>
 
 
<li>Password Security: 
• Prioritize security throughout the transition process by resetting or disabling all user passwords. This step helps prevent unauthorized access to the system and sensitive data. Notify users before the transition, instructing them to change their passwords to a temporary one provided. During the transition, enforce the creation of new, strong passwords by all users. </li>
 
<li>User Account Table: 
• Develop a table detailing the user accounts to be transferred or disabled. Include information such as usernames, associated email addresses, and specific privileges or access rights. Clearly indicate whether each account will be transferred or disabled, and provide any necessary instructions for the transition. </li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the transition of user accounts and passwords is a crucial component of the Chubby Gourmet project's transition plan. By creating a comprehensive account inventory, prioritizing password security, and establishing clear procedures for account transition and disablement, a seamless and secure transition can be achieved. </p>


==Knowledge Transfer==
<p>Documentation/Guides: </p>
<ul>
<li> The project team and senior developer will prepare comprehensive documentation and guides for Chubby Gourmet, covering various aspects of the system and its implementation. </li>
<li> The documentation will include a project overview, system architecture, functional requirements, technical specifications, and other relevant materials to provide a clear understanding of the system's workings. </li>
<li> The guides will offer detailed, step-by-step instructions on performing specific tasks related to the E-commerce web application. </li>
</ul
<p>Training: </p>
<ul>
<li> Chubby Gourmet's owner, Miss Priscilla Mariano, will receive personalized training from the project team to ensure a thorough understanding of the system's functionalities and processes. </li>
<li> Access to online training materials and resources will be provided to Miss Priscilla Mariano for continuous learning and skill development related to the E-commerce web application. </li>
<li> Miss Priscilla Mariano will be responsible for disseminating the acquired knowledge to relevant stakeholders within Chubby Gourmet.</li> 
</ul>
<p>To facilitate effective knowledge transfer, regular check-ins and meetings will be scheduled between the project team, senior developer, and Miss Priscilla Mariano. These sessions will ensure a successful transfer of knowledge and address any questions or concerns promptly. Additionally, any updates or changes to the system will be documented and shared with Miss Priscilla Mariano, enabling her to stay up to date with the latest information and functionalities of the E-commerce web application. </p>


==Handover and Acceptance==
<p>The initiation of the handover and acceptance process will commence upon the fulfillment of the implementation phase, encompassing all necessary documentation and deliverables. Subsequently, the project team will arrange a formal meeting with the project sponsor and other pertinent stakeholders to review the transition plan and verify the fulfillment of all requirements. </p>
<p>During the handover meeting, the project team will present the completed transition plan, along with all essential documentation and deliverables, to the project sponsor and relevant stakeholders. The presented materials will be thoroughly examined and discussed to address any remaining issues or concerns. </p>
<p>Once all matters are resolved, the project sponsor and stakeholders will endorse the formal acceptance document as proof of the successful completion of the handover. This acceptance document will encompass a checklist of all obligatory deliverables and documentation, featuring the signatures of the stakeholders who have reviewed and approved the materials. </p>
<p>Additionally, the handover and acceptance section will outline the procedure for resolving any lingering issues or concerns that may arise subsequent to the handover. This may involve following a formal dispute resolution process or implementing corrective measures to rectify identified deficiencies. </p>
<p>Overall, the handover and acceptance section within the contract transition out plan will offer a comprehensive and detailed roadmap for accomplishing the handover process, ensuring the satisfaction of all stakeholders with the outcomes. </p>



=Work Breakdown Structure=

==Introduction==
<p>The Chubby Gourmet Web Application project involves the development of an e-commerce web application that will enable the business to efficiently manage its market, streamline its processes and enhance its customer service. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for Chubby Gourmet project outlines the various work packages that must be accomplished to deliver a functional and user-friendly e-commerce web application. The WBS presents the project scope and helps in defining the deliverables that must be accomplished to meet the project objectives.
