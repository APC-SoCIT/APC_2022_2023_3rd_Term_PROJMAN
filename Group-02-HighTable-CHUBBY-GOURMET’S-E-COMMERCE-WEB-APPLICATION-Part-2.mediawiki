The identified risks will be assessed based on their probability of occurrence and their impact on the project. A risk matrix will be used to prioritize risks according to their severity. Risks with high severity will be given priority for mitigation or contingency planning. </li>
 
<li>Risk Mitigation: <br>
Mitigation plans will be developed for risks that have both a high impact and the likelihood of occurring. These plans will outline strategies and measures to reduce or prevent the risks. In cases where certain risks cannot be completely eliminated, backup strategies will be devised. </li>

<li>Risk Monitoring: <br>
Risks will be continuously monitored throughout the project. The project team will regularly review the risk register to ensure that risks are being effectively managed. As new risks are identified during the project, they will be added to the risk register and the risk assessment process will be repeated. </li>
 
<li>Risk Communication: <br>
Risk communication involves informing relevant parties, including the project sponsor, project team, and other stakeholders, about the identified risks and the strategies in place to manage them. The project team will maintain open and constant communication, ensuring that stakeholders are informed about any detected risks, their evaluation, and the actions being taken to address them. </li>
</ul>


==Risk Identification==
<p>Through a comprehensive risk identification process for the Chubby Gourmet project, various methods will be employed to identify and assess potential risks. These methods include expert interviews, analysis of historical data from previous projects, and a risk assessment conference involving the project team and key stakeholders. The aim is to create a risk register that documents the identified hazards, including a brief description, potential impact, and likelihood of occurrence. </p>

<p>During the risk assessment meeting, the project team and key stakeholders will actively engage in identifying and assessing risks specific to Chubby Gourmet's success. The outcomes of this meeting will be diligently recorded in the risk register, ensuring that all identified risks are captured. </p>

<p>To supplement the risk identification process, the project team will conduct a thorough review of historical information from similar projects. This will allow them to identify potential risks that might arise during the development of Chubby Gourmet and develop corresponding mitigation strategies. Additionally, expert interviews will be conducted with team members who possess relevant experience in developing similar systems. These interviews will provide valuable insights and help identify additional risks, which were then addressed through appropriate mitigation strategies. </p>

<p>The risks identified through the risk assessment meeting and expert interviews will be documented in a format consistent with the Agile risk management plan. The risk register is regularly updated to ensure the inclusion of new risks and the effective management of existing ones. Throughout the project lifecycle, the project team remains vigilant in monitoring and managing risks to mitigate their potential impact on Chubby Gourmet's development and overall success. </p>
