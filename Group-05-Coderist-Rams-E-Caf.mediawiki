==Risk Management Plan==
==Introduction==
<p>
  The Rams E-Caf: A Cafeteria Management System, aims to provide a system for the Asia Pacific College Cafeteria.
  The risk management plan includes an outline of the risk management process, the project team's duties and responsibilities, and the plan for risk assessments. The strategy will also outline the methods for managing and monitoring risks as well as the strategies for handling them. The efficiency of the plan will be evaluated by how quickly threats are found and addressed.
</p>

==Top Three Risks==
<ul>
  <li>The Rams E-Caf will not be accessed by the customers if the customers have no internet connection.</li>
  <li>The risk of connection interruption in the middle of payment process done with the use of payment gateways inside the Rams E-Caf web application.</li>
  <li>The unsynchronized stocks/available food amount displayed in the web application and the physical food stall may cause confusion and conflict.</li>
</ul>

==Risk Management Approach==
<ol>
  <li>Risk Identification and Assessment: The project team will identify project-related dangers through brainstorming sessions, research into previous project experiences, and appraisal of the project's requirements and scope. A risk registry will contain a list of the dangers as well as information on their description, potential impacts, and likelihood of occurrence. The risks that have been identified will be evaluated in terms of both their likelihood of happening and their impact on the project. Using the risk matrix, the project team will assess each risk according to its seriousness. High severity risks will be given priority for either contingency planning or mitigation.</li>
  <li>Risk Monitoring: Throughout the project, risks will be regularly watched for. The project team will periodically examine the risk register to make sure that risks are being managed appropriately. The risk assessment procedure will be repeated as new threats are discovered and added to the risk register during the project.</li>
  <li>Risk Mitigation: For hazards with a high effect and likelihood of occurrence, risk mitigation plans will be devised. The mitigation plans will contain risk-mitigation techniques. In addition, the project team will choose backup strategies for hazards that cannot be eliminated.</li>
  <li>Risk Communication: The process of informing relevant parties—such as the project sponsor, the project team, and other stakeholders—about risks and associated management techniques is known as risk communication. The project team will keep all stakeholders informed and continue frequent communication if any risks are found, evaluated, and dealt with.</li>
</ol>

==Risk Identification==
<p>
  The Rams E-Caf project utilized expert interviews, historical data analysis, and a risk assessment conference to identify and document risks. A risk register was created, containing descriptions, potential impact, and likelihood of occurrence. The project team and stakeholders participated in a risk assessment meeting, contributing to the identification and assessment of risks. The team also reviewed historical information and conducted expert interviews to identify additional risks and develop mitigation strategies. The identified risks are regularly updated in an Agile risk management plan to ensure effective risk management throughout the project. The following are a few of the project's potential risks for the Rams E-Caf project:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Human Error: Admin’s computer or devices that have access to the database of APC student’s information in the Rams E-Caf might be left open due to negligence which could leave the data open for anyone in the area to access.</li>
  <li>Security Vulnerabilities: The initiative runs the risk of being exposed to security lapses or data loss, both of which might have dire repercussions.</li>
  <li>Unforeseen Circumstances: There is a chance that unanticipated events (such market shifts) could have an unexpected effect on the project. The payment gateway company goes inactive or loses connection in the middle of payment.</li>
</ul>

==Risk Qualification and Prioritization==
<p>
  The project team will regularly review and update the risk record to make sure that risks are prioritized appropriately. The risks mentioned in the risk records were classified and evaluated using a probability-impact matrix. Risks that would have a significant effect on the project and a high possibility of occurring were given top consideration. Determine the probability and impact of each risk after analyzing potential risks related to Rams E-Caf business case. Following is an overview of the likelihood of risks and their effects on the project:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extreme: Risks that could seriously harm the project and have a very high possibility of happening.</li>
  <li>High: Risks that could have a big impact on the project and have a high chance of happening. The team must immediately address these risks and create mitigation plans for them.</li>
  <li>Medium: Risks that have an average chance of happening and a fair impact on the project. To prepare for these risks, mitigation plans should be created, and these risks should be continuously monitored.</li>
  <li>Low: Risks that have a small impact on the project and a low likelihood of occurring. Periodically monitoring these risks will allow for the development of mitigation plans in case they occur.</li>
  <li>Negligible: Risks that have little chance of happening and little effect on the project. These dangers can be disregarded.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://ibb.co/c8JSrBW"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/QH93KgW/Risk-Matrix.png" alt="Risk-Matrix" border="0"></a><br /><a target='_blank'</a><br />

  <li>Technical Risks:
    <ul>
      <li>High probability and high impact</li>

</ul>

==6.9.6 Risk Monitoring==
<p>
  The Rams E-Caf Agile Risk Management Plan offers a framework for actively tracking risks throughout the project. To do this, it is crucial to closely document the process, including defining the circumstances that might set off risks, and to regularly monitor risks during the project.
</p>
<p>
  The high-scoring risks will be incorporated into the project schedule, and the risk manager will be given responsibility for their monitoring. This will make it easier for the project manager to decide when hazards need to be closely monitored and when the risk manager should provide project team meetings with updates. The risk manager will oversee monitoring the risk trigger circumstances. The project manager will also make sure that the project team is informed of the risks that have been identified and their potential effects on the project. Any new risks or modifications to existing risks should be reported to the risk management by the project team so that they can be evaluated and given the appropriate level of priority.
</p>
<p>
  The project team will employ the agile risk management technique, which places an emphasis on adaptability and continuous development. The effectiveness of the risk management plan will be reevaluated as needed to ensure that the project's objectives and quality requirements are satisfied.
</p>

==6.9.7 Risk Mitigation and Avoidance==
<p>
  The risk management strategy will be created by the project team based on the weight each risk is given. Identification and prioritization of potential hazards is the first step in risk mitigation and avoidance. Alternative plans, greater resources, or a change in project deadlines are possible preparation techniques for expected delays. The project team should identify the risks that are most likely to occur and have the greatest potential impact, and then develop methods to lessen or eliminate those risks. The project manager has the following main factors and choices to think about:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resource Allocation: The project manager must make sure the team has the necessary resources, including competence, abilities, and expertise, as well as access to tools and equipment, for the project to be effective and efficient. The project manager oversees making sure that the team has access to these resources to complete the project on schedule and within the allocated budget.</li>
  <li>Risk Assessment: To effectively estimate and handle potential hazards, the team should do a detailed analysis of them. Early in the project, the risk assessment should be finished, and the project manager should move quickly to identify and reduce any potential risks.</li>
  <li>Contingency Planning: The project team must develop backup plans for emergencies to be ready for potential dangers. The project manager is responsible for supervising the creation, validation, and testing of these strategies for each potential risk.</li>
  <li>Agile Approach: Risk management can be done in a flexible and quick manner by using the Agile methodology. The team's use of the Agile methodology, which permits continual risk management and the capacity for change, must be ensured by the project manager.</li>
  <li>Communication: The project manager must encourage open and transparent communication between the project team, clients, and stakeholders to reduce risks and avoid misunderstandings.</li>
</ul>

==6.9.8 Risk Register==
<p>
  The risk register, which will be kept up to date throughout the project, will include comprehensive explanations of each risk, its likelihood, potential effects, and any mitigating measures. To ensure that it appropriately reflects the project's current situation, the risk register will be constantly reviewed and updated. All interested parties will have access to the risk register, which will be kept in a centralized location.
</p>
<p>
  This risk management approach emphasizes early and frequent risk discovery, collaborative risk management, and ongoing risk monitoring, which is frequently in line with the Agile methodology. The Rams E-Caf project team, Coderist, can lessen the effects and raise the possibility that the project will be successful by anticipating and resolving any hazards.

</ul>

==6.11.6. Subcontracts==
<p>There are no existing contracts or subcontract agreements related to this project. Therefore, no transition of contracts or related agreements is required.</p>

==6.11.7. Property Transition==

==6.11.7.1. Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)==
<p>Since there is no involvement of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) in the Rams E-Caf: A Web-Based Cafeteria Management System, this section of the transition plan is not applicable.</p>

==6.11.7.2. Incumbent Owned Equipment==
<p>In the context of the Rams E-Caf project, it is crucial to establish a clear understanding of the equipment ownership and transfer process to ensure a seamless transition and prevent any potential conflicts or misunderstandings. The transition plan should explicitly identify the equipment that is currently owned by the incumbent and will remain in their possession.</p>
<p>If there are specific equipment requirements to support the customer's applications and services, the plan should outline whether the new contractor or the customer has the option to purchase or utilize this equipment. The plan should also include a well-defined timeline for the transfer of ownership, highlighting key milestones and any necessary documentation, such as bills of sale or transfer of ownership agreements.</p>
<p>Considering the Rams E-Caf, if there are any equipment needs for the successful operation of the Rams E-Caf, it is important to clearly identify the incumbent-owned equipment and determine whether the new contractor or the customer has the option to acquire or use it. This clarification will facilitate effective coordination among all stakeholders involved in the transition, ensuring that all necessary equipment is readily available and properly accounted for.</p>
<p>Collaboration between the project team and relevant stakeholders is key in guaranteeing a smooth equipment transition process. It is imperative for the project team to proactively communicate with all parties involved, confirming the availability and proper transfer of all required equipment. By addressing equipment ownership and transfer within the transition plan, potential conflicts or misunderstandings can be mitigated, thereby enabling a seamless handover and minimizing any disruption to the Rams E-Caf operations.</p>

==Intellectual Property==
<p>During the transition process of the Rams E-Caf project’s, careful attention must be given to the handling of intellectual property (IP) to ensure a seamless transfer of all pertinent documentation, supplier and subcontractor information, service agreements, and original designs or plans. Intellectual property entails various legal considerations and may involve the completion of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) between the incumbent and the customer.</p>

<p>To ensure the proper handling of intellectual property during the transition, the following steps will be undertaken:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Identification of all relevant intellectual property:
    <p>A comprehensive identification of all intellectual property associated with the project will be conducted. This encompasses design documents, patents, trademarks, copyrights, software code, and any proprietary information or trade secrets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Evaluation of contractual agreements:
    <p>Existing contractual agreements pertaining to intellectual property ownership and transfer will be carefully reviewed and assessed to ensure compliance throughout the transition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Negotiation of new agreements:
    <p>If any gaps or inconsistencies are identified in the existing agreements, new agreements will be negotiated among the incumbent, new contractor, and the customer to ensure proper ownership and transfer of all intellectual property.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Protection of intellectual property:
    <p>During the transition period, all necessary measures, such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and other legal safeguards, will be implemented to safeguard the intellectual property from unauthorized disclosure or use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer of intellectual property:
    <p>Upon the successful completion of the transition process, all relevant intellectual property will be transferred in accordance with the contractual agreements in place. This may involve transferring the intellectual property to the new contractor, the customer, or retaining it with the incumbent, as specified in the contracts.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>By following these steps, the Rams E-Caf Project can ensure a smooth and secure transition of all intellectual property related to the project.</p>

==User Accounts and Passwords==
<p>As part of our transition plan for the Rams E-Caf project, we recognize the importance of ensuring a seamless transfer of user accounts and passwords. The following steps and considerations outline how we will handle this aspect of the transition:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    User Account Inventory:
    <p>Begin by creating a comprehensive inventory of all user accounts and their associated privileges. This inventory should encompass both internal and external users, including system administrators, third-party vendors, and end users.
    It is important to identify and specify which accounts are no longer active or necessary for the system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Password Security:
    <p>Ensure robust security during the transition process by resetting or disabling all user passwords. This step is essential to prevent unauthorized access to the system and its data.
    Notify users before the transition and instruct them to change their passwords to a temporary one provided to them. The new contractor or system owner should enforce the creation of new, secure passwords by all users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Account Transition and Disablement:
    <p>After addressing the inventory and password security measures, the next step involves identifying which accounts will be transitioned and which ones will be disabled.
    Clearly outline the individuals responsible for overseeing the smooth transfer of accounts and passwords.
    In cases where accounts are to be disabled, provide detailed procedures for promptly revoking access rights for terminated employees, contractors, or third-party vendors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Table of User Accounts:
    <p>Include a comprehensive table in the transition plan listing all user accounts earmarked for transition or disablement.
    This table should include important information such as the username, associated email address, and corresponding privileges or access rights.
    Additionally, specify whether the account will be transitioned or disabled and provide any specific instructions for the transition process.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, ensuring the seamless transfer of user accounts and passwords is a critical aspect of the Rams E-Caf's property transition plan within the Rams E-Caf framework. By following a systematic approach that includes creating an inventory, implementing password security measures, establishing clear procedures for account transition and disablement, and providing a comprehensive table of user accounts, a smooth and secure transition can be achieved.</p>

==Knowledge Transfer==
  ==Documentation/Manuals:==
  <ul>
    <li>The project team and developer will provide documentation and manuals to the Rams E-Caf: A Web-Based Cafeteria Management System.</li>
    <li>The documentation will include a project overview, system architecture, functional requirements, technical specifications, and other relevant documentation that can help the Rams E-Caf team better understand the system and how it works.</li>
  </ul>

It will follow a clear roadmap that includes the completion of a comprehensive transition plan, scheduling a formal handover meeting, and addressing any outstanding issues or concerns.</p>
  <p>Once the transition plan is finalized, encompassing all necessary documentation and deliverables, the project team will proceed to schedule a formal handover meeting. This meeting will involve the project sponsor and other relevant stakeholders who have a vested interest in the project's success. The purpose of this meeting will be to present the completed transition plan along with all the required documentation and deliverables.</p>
  <p>During the handover meeting, the project team will provide a detailed presentation of the transition plan, allowing the project sponsor and stakeholders to thoroughly review the materials. This review process will facilitate open discussions, enabling any outstanding issues or concerns to be addressed and resolved effectively. The aim is to ensure that all requirements and expectations have been met and that everyone involved is in agreement with the proposed handover.</p>
  <p>Upon the resolution of any outstanding issues, the project sponsor and stakeholders will proceed to sign a formal acceptance document. This document will serve as tangible evidence that the handover process has been successfully completed. It will also include a comprehensive checklist of all the required deliverables and documentation, providing a clear record of what has been reviewed and approved by the stakeholders.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the handover and acceptance section of the contract transition out plan will outline the procedures for managing any outstanding issues or concerns that may arise post-handover. This section may include a formal dispute resolution process or the implementation of corrective actions to address any identified deficiencies. The objective is to ensure that all stakeholders remain satisfied and that any ongoing challenges are appropriately managed and resolved.</p>
  <p>By following this structured handover and acceptance process, the Rams E-Caf project team aims to provide a clear roadmap for the completion of the handover phase. This approach emphasizes effective communication, comprehensive review, and proactive resolution of any outstanding matters, ultimately contributing to a successful transition and stakeholder satisfaction.</p>
