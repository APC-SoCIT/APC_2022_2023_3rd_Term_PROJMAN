<p><strong>Brief Background:</strong></p>
<p></p>

=Business Case=
==Executive Summary==

<p>This business case will tackle on business concerns regarding the proponents proposed project RAM-IT, business concerns like, the benefits of the project, the recommendations that the proponents can bring, the justifications to give importance to why the project is needed for the specific problem it is trying to solve. This document will also have information regarding the current details in its development cycle, for example, the milestones, the performance, the constraints, and the assumptions.</p>

===Issue===

<p>APC’s ITRO has been able to handle inquiries ever since its establishment in the school, whether it was through their Outlook E-mail or through In-person inquiring. It was fully accepted by the community, but there are still some lacking capabilities with their existing methods on handling inquiries like:</p>
<li>Being unable to provide support or answer inquiries in a time efficient manner due to unavailability of the ITRO staff because of demanding and abundant workload.</li>
<li>Being unable to delegate, organize, and track the progress of current and incoming inquiries.</li>
<li>Having no tracking mechanism on the priority levels of the inquiries that may be given to them that can lead to FAQs being answered one-by-one instead of the staff focusing more on specific concerns that need their attention.</li>

===Anticipated Outcomes===
<p>Once the ITRO has implemented RAM-IT as a system for managing and handling their inquiries, it will enable them to have a faster way on handling FAQs through the chatbot, they will be able to answer the urgent and high-priority tasks with the priority feature, and they will also have the data like records, and reports be available to them in the system. This will also benefit APC and the community as it enables them to have their inquiries answered promptly and effectively. The end state of this project is for the system to be fully implemented in the ITRO and the APC community using this system for their inquiries and concerns.</p>

===Recommendation===

<p>There are types of technology that can solve business problems, but the proponents have decided that a ticketing system with a chatbot feature will be the optimal choice. This is because it enables the ITRO to have a better and more efficient way of handling FAQs through the chatbot having prompted answers for frequent concerns that come from the community. A more effective way of handling specific concerns that are asked online is through the ticketing system and its chat feature in which the inquirer can communicate with an ITRO staff via chat. This also assists them in managing these inquiries, in terms of delegation of tasks and prioritizing the urgent concerns. It also enables them to have records and reports to give them data regarding the concerns that they face and how abundant they are given a span of time which are all available and displayed in the system.  </p>

===Justification===

<p>RAM-IT should be implemented as a system that enables ITRO to handle and manage inquiries, because it improves efficiency in terms of time and method of answering inquiries. Helpdesks and/or ticketing systems have been implemented in numerous companies and schools because they are helpful on enabling their respective technical offices on managing their inquiries, as well as have the inquirers having a designated platform to track and send their inquiries to the ITRO. It should also be implemented as the system can be further improved upon by the ITRO, for example, adding more features that are present in other existing ticketing systems that may benefit the project. The unique feature about RAM-IT is that it enables an efficient communication for two kinds of questions whether it be frequently asked questions which are answered through the chatbot if the inquiry is present there or specific questions which are addressed by the ITRO and will be communicated with them through the chat feature.</p>

==Problem Definition==
<p> The ITRO has been handling inquiries regarding technical concerns, concerns can range from password problems, borrowing equipment, and many more. They do this with the use of Microsoft Outlook and allowing students to inquire in-person by visiting the ITRO office. The problem with this method however (especially for online inquiries) is that time for inquiries to be addressed will always vary with the ITRO’s availability. Another problem is that ITRO doesn’t have a method to track all their inquiries all at once in a single page, leading them to always backtrack within their e-mails. Lastly, they are unable to identify if the concerns being given to them are questions that already have answers to them before or specific questions that need their communication to be resolved.</p>

=Schedule Management Plan=

==Introduction==

<p>For every project that will be created or built, there is always a record of the time and where the deliverables are placed. Deliverables that are either to be started, ongoing, and complete, here thus also lie the plans for the future of the projects which in the case of a technological project is called either update or upgrade.</p>

<p>The Schedule Management Plan is technically one of the most important aspects of planning to create a program where it records and even lists deadlines for each part of the project. The purpose of the schedule management plan for technological projects is to complete a specific program in order and thus monitor the insights of the developers in the first place are thoroughly followed.</p>

==Schedule Management Approach==

<p>There is a software called Project Libre, it was introduced and taught to the developers of the project. In Project Libre, the developers list, plans out, and monitor the parts of the project that moves the progress of building the program. </p>

<p>The said software helps the team to approach the schedule management plan. The developers include a specific format to be easily understood which reviews the progress now and then. This software also indicates the milestones of the project, which under these milestones are deliverables of each member that records the progress, roles, and responsibilities.</p>

==Schedule Control==

<p>With the help of how the developers approached the schedule management plan, the team was able to put the management under control. The team was able to control schedule management not only with the said application but also with the help of Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Teams reminds the members about meetings that tackle the listed plan in the team's Project Libre.</p>

<p>For the communication and updates that control, and follow the flow of the plan for the project. Microsoft Teams is effective and efficient, and with its Calendar, the team meetings are reminded. Communicating with the team helps the members with their deliverables and deadlines. With this kind of control, it will be easy for the team to be notified if the project has a minor or major update will be added to the project.</p>

<p>Group or Team meetings are important not only for brainstorming and communicating about the project but also this reminds the team about the schedule management plan of the project.</p>

==Schedule Changes and Thresholds==

<p>As for the team's development progress, there is a consistent and planned schedule since each member of the team must be updated on little by little progress of each work. The team expects that at any time in the progress, there will be multiple circumstances of schedule changes and the deliverables or project thresholds.</p>

<p>For the team to comply with these kinds of situations, we do not set or stack up the contents and the lists of deliverables from the schedule management plan for that it would be possible and still on track and thus maintain the consistency of the progress of the project if there will be changes from the schedules of each member, deliverables and the deadlines that can also affect the threshold which if managed well, the team will not have a hard time to re-adjust.</p>

<p>The team allotted more or less 42% per week to comply with these circumstances, which will create a more or less 33% change in the threshold for the monthly deliverable or milestone of the project.</p>

==Scope Change==

<p>The given allotted dates, times, or days in the team's schedule management plan will not ruin the plan if a change will occur during the progress. It will be less workload for the team and its project manager to readjust or re-baselined the schedule management plan. </p>

<p>The team consists of a few members, so assigning more deliverables for each day would stack up and may end in confusion or forgetting about the assigned deliverables, it will create havoc within the schedule management plan, depending on the change that will occur.</p>

<p>The proper management and setting of the schedule management plan will affect the developers, the team, and the project manager that oversees the progress from time to time. It will be easier to monitor, adjust and add if there will be changes within the plan.</p>

<p>The given preparedness within the schedule management plan is also the scope of the team, although the team expects multiple changes during the progress. As developers, the team must prepare for minor or major adjustments and changes in the schedule management plan.</p>
