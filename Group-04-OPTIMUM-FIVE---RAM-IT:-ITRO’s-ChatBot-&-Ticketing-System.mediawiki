=Company Profile=
<p><strong>Brief Background:</strong></p>
<p>M.C. Manabat is a sole proprietorship business that mainly sells computer, computer peripherals, and Software. Currently the client only does things manually and they use mobile phones when receiving orders from the customers and ordering to the supplier.</p>
<p>The business wants to adopts the J.I.T(Just-In-Time) approach because J.I.T (Just-In-Time) inventory system has several advantages like production runs remain short, reduces costs and eliminates warehouse storage needs, companies also spend less money on raw materials because they buy just enough to make the products and no more, just like the J.I.T ordering system they will only order the item from the supplier when the customer orders the item, reducing cost and eliminating warehouse storage needs.</p>

=Business Case=
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The M.C Manabat is a retail business that sells monitors, telephones, televisions etc. by sending out business proposal to different offices and companies. The problem in the business is that their sales and services are in poor condition due to the fact that M.C Manabat&rsquo;s business still uses phone to negotiate and inquiring the customers about the item&rsquo;s availability which obviously takes a lot of time because there are tons of types and branding for each product that it may take a while for the customer to choose, lastly M.C Manabat wanted to sell his products to individuals to widen their market range and possibly increase their sales, taking all those information into account, the project team came up with the conclusion to create a website that enables the customer to navigate and view&nbsp; product information by also doing a website that is publicly available to all people who access the site with that being said the project team assumes that M.C Manabat would gain new kinds of customer and will increase their sales.</p>

<h2>Issue</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current issue of the business that the proposed project will address is the lack of visibility for the Customer to view the products that M.C Manabat sells and most of the time the misunderstanding between M.C Manabat and the Supplier and also between M.C Manabat and the Customer because they communicate using mobile phones or telephones.</p>
<h2>Anticipated Outcomes</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anticipated outcome of this proposed project if it is successfully implemented is that it would increase the sale of the business by widening its market range because the products of M.C Manabat would be available online, this project will also help the business have its own platform wherein the M.C Manabat, the supplier and the customer can communicate.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project team members have proposed different options and alternatives in finding the best way to improve the business processes and eliminate the costs of the manual processes that are still being done in the business. The project team have concluded that the best way to improve the technology and the performance of the business is to have a website because having a website would widen the market range of M.C Manabat&rsquo;s product and help the business have its own platform wherein they can communicate with their suppliers and customers. </p>

<h2>Justification</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The implementation of the JIT E-commerce Website would reduce if not eliminate the manual business processes currently done in the business, it could also possibly help the business increase their sales by making their products available online and making their products available online widens the market range of their products and possibly increasing their sales.</p>
