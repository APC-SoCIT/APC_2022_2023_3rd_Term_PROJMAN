<h2><strong>Brief Background:</strong></h2>
<p>M.C. Manabat is a sole proprietorship business that mainly sells computer, computer peripherals, and Software. Currently the client only does things manually and they use mobile phones when receiving orders from the customers and ordering to the supplier.</p>
<p>The business wants to adopts the J.I.T(Just-In-Time) approach because J.I.T (Just-In-Time) inventory system has several advantages like production runs remain short, reduces costs and eliminates warehouse storage needs, companies also spend less money on raw materials because they buy just enough to make the products and no more, just like the J.I.T ordering system they will only order the item from the supplier when the customer orders the item, reducing cost and eliminating warehouse storage needs.</p>

<h2>Issue</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current issue of the business that the proposed project will address is the lack of visibility for the Customer to view the products that M.C Manabat sells and most of the time the misunderstanding between M.C Manabat and the Supplier and also between M.C Manabat and the Customer because they communicate using mobile phones or telephones.</p>
<h2>Anticipated Outcomes</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anticipated outcome of this proposed project if it is successfully implemented is that it would increase the sale of the business by widening its market range because the products of M.C Manabat would be available online, this project will also help the business have its own platform wherein the M.C Manabat, the supplier and the customer can communicate.</p>
