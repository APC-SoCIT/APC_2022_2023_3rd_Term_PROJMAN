<h1>Business Case</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Fleeky Hub is a Local online retailer of curtains and draperies. By offering a wide selection of curtain colors, materials,  and  styles  at  an  affordable  price,  we  aim  to  provide  our  clients  with  an  easy  and  simple purchasing experience. The project proposed will be simple to use and offer each consumer a stress-free buying experience.</p><p>Fleeky Hub's business strategy is based on an online shopping platform such as Shopee, which has seen drastic growth in recent years due to most of businesses transitioning to an online platform as well as the demand  for  online  purchasing.  Online  shopping  has  seen  a  significant  trend  due  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing this upward trend, Fleeky Hub gives clients the ability of purchasing their curtains from the convenience of the clients' respective homes. Our web shop is available 24/7, allowing customers to shop at their convenience. </p>

<h2>Issue</h2>

<p>There were  multiple  issues  that arose  during  the  pandemic  and  post  pandemic  on  the business of Fleeky Curtains, since the employees of the business are all members of the family there are times when some of them have different schedules and personal agendas due to some them are still studying, and this has been a pain point in their business since when there  is  a depletion  in  terms  of  the  staff  the processing  of  orders  and  customer services  would  be  gravely  affected.  Another  problem  of Fleeky Curtains  was  the processing the  clients'  orders,  since they  are using  a  traditional  method  of  manually encoding order information to the system, which becomes a problem since the processing of customer information becomes redundant and time consuming.</p>

<h2>Anticipated Outcomes</h2>

<p>The  outcome  of  the  project  will  help  them open their  market  to  different channels. Having their own domain and their site will lose their dependency to other e-commerce sites which was also stated that they are having challenges in terms of their commission rates as per customer purchase at the e-commerce site. With the help of the project, it will lessen the costs of the business and stabilize production and growth of the sales. This will also be a place to lead the customer in purchasing their likes and needs.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

<p>Add feature that guests customers can also make their purchases at the site rather than creating an account in the first place. It would be better also to add a friendly viewing experience when it is accessed via mobile phone. </p><p>Fleeky Hub's features and functionalities streamline various tasks, automate repetitive processes,  and  provide  tools  for  efficient  management  of  tasks  and  workflows.  As  a result, employees can complete their tasks faster and with increased accuracy, leading to improved productivity and reduced processing time. </p><p>Furthermore,  the  integration  of  Fleeky  Hub  allows  for  the  digitalization  of  manual processes.  The  platform  enables  the  automation  of  tasks  that  were  previously  done manually, such as data entry, scheduling, and reporting. This not only eliminates the risk of errors associated with manual processes but also increases the overall efficiency and accuracy of the operations. The digitalization of processes also enables real-time tracking and  monitoring  of  tasks,  providing  managers  with  better  visibility  and  control  over operations. </p><p>In  addition,  Fleeky  Hub  offers  a  wide  range  of  features  that  can  help  create  a  better working environment for the client's employees. For example, it provides collaboration tools that facilitate communication and coordination among team members, helping to streamline workflows and improve overall team productivity. It also offers reporting and analytics features that provide insights into team performance and allow for data-driven decision   making.   These   features   can   lead   to   a   more   organized,   efficient,   and collaborative working environment for the employees, enhancing their job satisfaction and overall well-being.</p>

<h2>Justification</h2>

<p>Not only the group will provide the platform to its client to help its daily operations, but also to establish a means where the client’s business can invite or encourage other potential  customers  in patronizing their product and  even have the potential  to touch other markets that they previously do not reach for a greater yield. </p><p>As local stores leverage several types of software, social media, and modern technologies to  market  their  products,  integrating  Fleeky  Hub  can  be  the  most  effective  approach. This will centralize the web marketing process for Fleeky Curtains, while also providing an  opportunity  to  utilize  the  features  integrated  by  Fleeky  Hub  to  monitor  customer behavior towards their products. Such monitoring will aid Fleeky Curtains in identifying profitable products and making informed decisions about their production strategy. </p><p>By  integrating  Fleeky  Hub  into  their  marketing  efforts,  Fleeky  Curtains  can  streamline and optimize their online marketing processes. The platform offers a range of features that  can  help  manage  and  track  marketing  campaigns,  analyze  customer  data, and provide valuable insights into customer behavior. This information can be utilized to gain a  deeper  understanding  of  customer  preferences,  purchasing  patterns,  and  product performance. </p><p>With  these  insights,  Fleeky  Curtains  can  make  data-driven  decisions  to  optimize  their production  strategy.  They  can  identify  which  products  are  performing  well  and  adjust their  production  schedule  accordingly.  For  instance,  if  certain  products  are  in  high demand,  Fleeky  Curtains  can  allocate  more  resources  to  produce  them  and  ensure sufficient  stock  is  available.  On  the  other hand, if  certain  products  are  not  performing well, production can be adjusted or discontinued to avoid excess inventory</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>With family members often occupied with their own commitments at work, school, or home, managing a business can become challenging in terms of time management.</p><p> Running  a  business  requires considerable  time and  effort,  including  tasks  such  as marketing,  operations,  finance,  and  customer  management.  However,  when  family members have their own individual responsibilities and schedules to attend to, it can be challenging  to  allocate  sufficient  time  to  the  business.  Competing  priorities  and  busy schedules  may  result  in  limited  availability  to  focus  on  the  business  and  its  various aspects.</p>
<p>Having a limited number of employees means they are bound to achieve less activities:</p>

<p>1. Delayed response to customer inquiries that frequently asks on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Availability (how many products are on-hand)
</li>
<li>
Actual photos of the product.
</li>
<li>
The size and fabric.
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Staffs/employees has difficulties in knowing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If there is any new or ongoing confirmed order.
</li>
<li>
Status update of the ongoing order.
</li>
<li>
The details of the orders.
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Seldomly encodes information as it takes too long to manually record on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sales and expenses
</li>
<li>
Customer information
</li>
<li>
Customer order
</li>
<li>
The availability of raw materials inside the inventory
</li>
</ul>
4. Inconsistent recording of sales and transactions of customers, alongside with its order details and customer information, that leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Inaccurate reading of business profit and loss
</li>
<li>
Unreliable reports
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In summary, while having a limited number of employees can pose challenges in managing business activities, proactive measures such as implementing technology solutions and optimizing processes can help mitigate these challenges and lead to improved productivity and success in the long run.

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The pandemic has caused businesses to adapt quickly, using social media platforms such as Facebook and e-commerce platforms to sell their products. Fleeky Curtains is an independent family business that provides curtain products. They operate the business at the local household and book a courier to pick up the item and deliver the item to the customer. They aim to grow their market share in the home product industry by observing and adapting to the behavior of the consumers. The employees in the business consist of the members of the family where they take charge of the sewing, assemble the packaging, the messages at Facebook, Shopee inquiries, product inspection, and one that list and encode transactions and customer information. Despite having a limited number of employees, the business wishes to accomplish tasks at an efficient rate due to the lack of workforce/person. The most important details in this text are the production time, packaging time, encoding time, number of products and raw materials, inquiries, available products, expanding the potential clients, and the staff. Fleeky Curtains mentioned that when there is no assistant, the staff finishes the tasks behind time, and that handling and assembling the packaging of one customer order takes 25 minutes of their time. Additionally, the staff must cope with their sleep and roles at work or school, and they must adapt to the market. Fleeky Curtains is an e-commerce company that uses a variety of materials to produce their products. Raw materials such as fabrics, threads, grommet, and curtain rings are used to build a finish product, and packaging materials such as bubble wrap are used to cover the products. Spending activities are traced and recorded within an Excel sheet, and customer data is stored in an Excel sheet. Customer data helps them to identify customer behavior and consumerism, and user experience is most observed when presented with convenience. They have gained knowledgeable feedback and experience revolving to their current system and workflows. Spotlight interviewed one of the admins that handle Fleeky Curtains, Mr. Neil Albert Garcia, to discuss their pain points when it comes to handling their business. These include fees and expenses to the e-commerce platform, poor delivery system, manual encoding of customer details, raw materials and on-hand stocks not documented and audited, finding ways to expand their clients and markets, and manual reports and tracing the performance of the business. These inputs will help align the project with the client's needs and interests. </p>

<h2>Project Purpose/Justification</h2>

<p>The existing system may be improved by implementing contemporary technology, moving to a better design, and allowing administrators to quickly monitor operations, inventory, and activity. Fleeky Hub will also help employees complete their responsibilities more quickly by tracking departing orders, understanding what has to be packed, what needs to be prepared, what inventories are available, and encoding client information. Prospective company owners, particularly those with small firms, can benefit from Project Akbay's efficiency features, which will allow them to handle orders more quickly and monitor their operations. The relevance of the project for developers, future researchers, company owners, administrators, and employees is that it will provide them with a better grasp of how to design, improve, and execute a stronger basis for their product. Objectives for Sustainable Development (SDGs SDG 8 to increase economic productivity and SDG 9 to develop and promote innovative technology both complement the initiative. The use of the product and the recording of the study will help future studies and offer a better answer for those in need.</p>

<h2>Business Need/Case</h2>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<p>In creating a website for Fleeky Curtains, targeting the customers and their market should be considered on the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	Consumers will be interested in buying curtains online and will trust the website to deliver high-quality items and customer service. 
    </li>
	<li>
	There is a substantial market demand for curtains and window coverings to meet the website's business strategy and revenue targets. 
	</li>
	<li>
	When compared to other online and physical merchants, the website will be able to provide comparable prices. 
	</li>
	<li>
	The website will have access to a trustworthy and cost-effective supply chain for obtaining curtains from manufacturers and suppliers. 
	</li>
	<li>
	The website will be able to recruit and keep a strong team of web developers, designers, and marketing specialists to establish and operate the website.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Preliminary Scope Statement</h2>

<p>The scope of this project is to develop a website that helps the employees of Fleeky Curtains manage their customers, and their orders, by redirecting them to make purchases at the site. The main scope is for businesses to be able to address staff's challenges at their tasks and cater to their customers in an efficient way. The project also aims to aid the efficiency for businesses that do their ordering systems manually, enabling to increase the business' efficiency in handling continuous orders and documenting transactions and information seamlessly. The group will be looking to become a website to reduce the staff's time in handling customer inquiries on the products and direct the customer to order inside the website, as well as to navigate according to the customer liking and put the business in a leading edge compared to its competitors. </p>

<h2>Risks</h2>

<p>There are several business risks linked with selling curtains online. A curtain firm may encounter the following risks, which are among of the most frequent:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	Cybersecurity risks: Internet commerce platforms are susceptible to assaults that might lead to the loss of confidential consumer information or interfere with daily operations. To secure their data and client information, businesses must make sure they have proper security measures in place. 
	</li>
	<li>
	Logistics and shipping: To deliver their goods, online selling platforms must rely on logistics and shipping partners. Inaccuracies or delays in the shipping procedure might lead to missing or damaged goods, unhappy customers, and perhaps lost sales. 
	</li>
        <li>
	Reputation risks: Include negative customer experiences like subpar products, delayed delivery, or bad customer service. Negative criticism may be amplified through social media and online review platforms, therefore it's critical for businesses to actively manage their online reputation. 
	</li>
        <li>
	Pricing and competition: The internet marketplace may be quite competitive, with numerous merchants providing the same things at various price points. To preserve profitability while still being competitive, businesses must control their pricing strategy. 
	</li>
        <li>
	Technical risks: Online selling platforms depend on technology to run, and problems with that technology can cost businesses money and make customers unhappy. To reduce the risk of technical difficulties, businesses must have a strong technological infrastructure.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>To guarantee the long-term viability of their business, Fleeky Curtains must evaluate and reduce these risks. A curtains company can lessen the potential negative impact on their business and customers and position themselves for success in the online selling space by putting measures in place to manage these risks, such as investing in cybersecurity, working with reputable logistics and shipping providers, offering top-notch customer service, and complying with legal and regulatory requirements.</p>

<h1>Cost Management Plan</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In Fleeky Curtains, the management and the employees are responsible for keeping the business running. Since the client is a small business handled by the family members, each of the decisions and budget planning is in the scope of the family members. The investor and the founder of Fleeky Curtains is the one who finances the business, Mitzi Garcia. She also oversees which products to be invested and the raw materials to supplement the production of curtains. The investor also has the authority to approve the changes to the project of Fleeky Hub and carrying out the budget for the business and the project</p>

<p>On the other note, the manager Neil Albert Garcia does the administrative tasks and manages the accounting for the transactions and expenses for the business. The manager also oversees the operations.</p>


<p>Cost Management Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Project Manager will be responsible for overall cost management of the project and will be the primary point of contact for all cost-related issues.
</li>
<li>
The Finance Team will be responsible for monitoring project costs and ensuring that they are within the approved budget.
</li>


<p>Cost Change Approval:</p>

<li>
All cost changes must be approved by the Project Manager before they are implemented.
</li>
<li>
If the cost change exceeds 10% of the total project budget, it must be approved by the Project Sponsor before it can be implemented.
</li>

<p>Cost Measurement and Reporting:</p>

<li>
Costs will be measured and reported monthly, using a cost performance index (CPI) and a schedule of performance index (SPI)
</li>
<li>
Reports will be presented to the Project Sponsors monthly.
</li>

<p>Budget Format and Standards:</p>

<li>
The Budget will be presented in a clear and concise format, using a spreadsheet format such as Excel and Fleeky Hub’s Website feature (If implemented/upon agreement)
</li>
<li>
The budget will be broken down into individual line items, with detailed cost estimates for each item.
</li>
<li>
The budget will be updated monthly, with any changes clearly highlighted
</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the Cost Management Plan for the Fleeky Hub project is designed to ensure that all costs associated with the project are effectively managed and controlled, so that the project can be completed within the approved budget. This will help ensure that the project is completed successfully and on time.</p>


<h2>Cost Management Approach</h2>

<p>The Cost Management approach for the dispatch directory system project will be based on the following principles</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Clear definitions of costs: The project team will work closely with stakeholders to clearly define and document the cost associated with the project, including development, materials, tools, API, and other expenses that are included within the project development contract agreement.
</li>
<li>
Budget development tracking: A detailed project budget will be developed and regularly updated throughout the project, with costs tracked and reported in real time.
</li>
<li>
Cost estimates: The project team will use a variety of cost estimation techniques to ensure that the project budget is accurate and realistic.
</li>
<li>
Cost variance analysis: The project team will closely monitor costs throughout the project and perform variance analysis to identify and address any cost overruns or savings.
</li>
<li>
Cost management roles and responsibilities: Clear roles and responsibilities for cost management will be defined and communicated to all project team members
</li>
<li>
Approval process for changes: A formal process for approving changes to the project or its budget will be established and implemented.
</li>
<li>
Reporting and communication: Regular cost reports will be prepared and shared with stakeholders, including the project sponsor, project team, and management.
</li>
</ol>

<p>By following these principles and practices, the project team will be able to effectively manage costs and ensure that the project stays on budget.</p>

<h2>Measuring Project Costs</h2>

<p>The Cost Management Plan for the Fleeky Hub project will include a detailed approach for measuring project cost using Earned Value Management (EVM). This will involve capturing and reporting on various Earned Value metrics, such as:</p>

<p>1.    Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) – These measures the budgeted costs of the work that was planned to be completed at a specific point of time.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p>To calculate the BCWS or Planned Value, we need to multiply the total labor cost of the TESTING WBS by its percentage of completion:</p>
<p>BCWS</p>

<p>= Total labor cost of TESTING WBS x Percentage of completion</p>

<p>= (PHP 25,000) x 33.71%</p>

<p>= PHP 8,427.50</p>

<p>Therefore, the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) for the TESTING WBS is PHP 8,427.50</p>


<h2>Reporting Format</h2>

<p>Reporting for cost management will be included in the monthly project status report. The Monthly Project Status Report will include a section labeled, “Cost Management”. This section will contain the Earned Value Metrics identified in the previous section. All cost variances outside of the thresholds identified in this Cost Management Plan will be reported on including any corrective actions which are planned. Change Requests which are triggered based upon project cost overruns will be identified and tracked in this report.</p>

The budgeted amount for the website development is higher than the actual amount just to be safe whenever possible improvement or modification will be added.
</li>
<li>
The domain name and hosting for the website is to be subscribed to Linode for two dollars per month and we increased the allotted budget for the whole year.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost Variance Response Process</h2>

<p>The Cost Variance Response process for ADENICSY project will be as follows:</p>
<p>1. Control Thresholds:<br>
 - Several control criteria for cost variation will be specified for the project.<br>
 - These limits will be 3%, 7%, and 10% of the project's overall budget.<br>
 - The project will be deemed to have a cost variance if any of these criteria are reached.</p>

<p>2. Identification of Variance:<br>
 - The Project Manager oversees locating any cost variations and informing the Project Sponsor about them.<br>
 - To find and monitor any variations, the project manager will make use of earned value metrics and other cost management tools.</p>

<p>3. Analysis of Variance:<br>
 - To pinpoint the source of the issue and provide choices for remedial action, the project manager will examine the deviation.<br>
 - The project manager will also take into account how the deviation may affect the project's scope and timeline.</p>

<p>4. Presentation of Options:<br>
 - The project manager will give the project sponsor a presentation on the possibilities for remedial action.<br>
 - The choices will depend on the underlying reason for the deviation and how it affects the project's scope and timeline.</p>

<p>5. Approval of Corrective Action:<br>
 - After considering the available choices, the project sponsor will decide on a course of action to get the project back on track.<br>
 - This can entail raising the budget, lowering the scope or quality, or taking other remedial measures.</p>

<p>6. Implementation of Corrective Action:<br>
 - The project manager will put the agreed corrective action into practice and keep an eye on the outcomes.<br>
 - The project manager will also make the necessary updates to the budget and timeline.</p>

<p>7. Reporting:<br>
 - In the monthly project status report, the project manager will note any cost variances, remedial actions performed, and their outcomes.<br>
 - The project manager will also give updates on the budget and timeline for the project.</p>

<p>Throughout the course of the project, the Cost Variance Response procedure will be active. The Project Sponsor will oversee authorizing any necessary remedial steps, while the Project Manager will be in charge of monitoring and regulating the project expenditures.</p>

<h2>Cost Change Control Process</h2>

<p>The cost change control process will follow the established project change request process. Approvals for project budget/cost changes must be approved by the project sponsor</p>

<h2>Project Budget</h2>
<p>The budget for this project is detailed below.  Costs for this project are presented in various categories...</p>

<h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>

<p>An effective human resources management plan is crucial for the successful completion of any project. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of all project team members and stakeholders, ensuring that everyone is aware of their individual contributions and how they fit into the bigger picture.<br>

The plan also defines the level of authority and decision-making power held by each team member, ensuring that resources are allocated and utilized effectively. By clearly defining competencies and skill requirements, the plan ensures that the right people are in the right roles to achieve project success.<br>
 
Overall, the human resources management plan acts as a roadmap for the project team, guiding them towards successful project execution and delivery.</p>

<h2>Project Organizational Charts</h2>
<p>Project organizational chart of the Dispatch Directory System provides a visual representation of the project team and the relationships between the key stakeholders. The project sponsor is typically at the top of the chart, followed by the project manager who is responsible for managing the project's resources, scope, and schedule. An internal user of the system, such as the CREST Team, may also be included to provide input on the system requirements and participate in user testing. Two external users of the system (TELUS Technicians, and TELUS Managers) may also be included to provide feedback on the system's usability and functionality. The organizational chart helps to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder, ensuring that everyone is aligned with the project's goals and objectives.</p>

<h2>Staffing Management</h2>
<p>Fleeky Hub's Staffing Management Plan for the Dispatch Directory System project plays a vital role in ensuring the success of the project. It includes the strategies and procedures for acquiring, supervising, and relinquishing human resources throughout the lifecycle of a project.<br>

Fleeky Hub will quickly acquire human resources to assure the availability of necessary skills and expertise when needed. This may entail recruiting new employees, employing contractors, or utilizing internal personnel. To ensure their availability, the acquisition of resources will be coordinated with the project timeline. </p>

<ul>
<li>
In cases where skill deficits have been identified, Fleeky Hub will provide training to ensure that team members possess the necessary skills and knowledge to perform effectively. This training may consist of both formal and informal programs. 
</li>
<li>
To assess the efficacy of team members and identify areas for improvement, we will conduct routine performance reviews. These evaluations will also provide feedback on the degree to which team members are reaching the project's requirements and objectives. 
</li>
<li>
To recognize and motivate exceptional performance, Fleeky Hub will institute a rewards and recognition system that may include bonuses, promotions, and other incentives. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the scope of the project, the personnel management plan may also include elements such as compliance with government and regulatory requirements, organizational health, and safety. These considerations will depend on the industry-specific requirements and location of the undertaking. If the Dispatch Directory System endeavor involves data privacy and security regulations, for instance, compliance with government laws will be essential. Moreover, organizational health and safety measures will be implemented if the project utilizes apparatus or technology that poses potential dangers to team members.</p>

By putting this strategy into action, we hope to enhance collaboration, handle problems quickly, and build a shared understanding among stakeholders.<br>

The customer, project team, management, end users, and support staff are all involved in the Fleeky Curtains project. Each stakeholder is critical to the project's success, and efficient communication among them is essential for meeting project goals.<br>

This plan's communication objectives include keeping stakeholders up to date on project progress, milestones, and timelines, facilitating collaboration and coordination among project team members, gathering feedback to address concerns, and providing a platform for sharing project knowledge and updates.<br> 

Various communication channels will be used to attain these goals. Project meetings will be held to discuss progress, resolve concerns, and plan future activities. Email will be utilized for official updates and document exchange, whilst collaboration tools and instant messaging platforms will allow for real-time cooperation and casual contact among team members. Stakeholder surveys will be undertaken on a regular basis to collect input, and status reports will be distributed to offer an overview of project achievements and forthcoming activities. In addition, as a consolidated source of project information, a dedicated project website or portal will be built.<br>

To guarantee successful communication management, roles and duties are clearly defined. The project manager will oversee managing communication operations in general, while a communication coordinator will support and coordinate communication efforts. Team members and stakeholders will communicate actively, offering updates, comments, and requesting clarification as needed.<br>

Regular reviews will be done to monitor and assess the success of the communication strategy, which will include input from stakeholders, communication logs, and project performance indicators. This will allow us to make the required modifications and enhancements to the project's communication methods.<br>

We intend to establish a collaborative atmosphere, develop effective communication, and assure the successful implementation of the Fleeky Curtains project by adopting this Communication Management Plan. We can overcome problems, align stakeholders, and provide a high-quality product that satisfies the requirements and expectations of all parties involved by communicating transparently and consistently.<br>

Proper management of IP entails addressing legal considerations and may involve the completion of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) between the incumbent and the customer.</p>
  
  <p>To ensure the appropriate handling of intellectual property during the transition, the following steps will be undertaken:</p>
  
  <h4>Identification of Relevant Intellectual Property:</h4>
  <p>All intellectual property associated with the project will be identified, encompassing design documents, patents, trademarks, copyrights, software code, and any proprietary information or trade secrets.</p>
  
  <h4>Evaluation of Contractual Agreements:</h4>
  <p>Existing contractual agreements concerning intellectual property ownership and transfer will be carefully reviewed and assessed to ensure compliance throughout the transition.</p>
  
  <h4>Negotiation of New Agreements:</h4>
  <p>If any gaps or inconsistencies are identified in the existing agreements, new agreements will be negotiated among the incumbent, new contractor, and the customer. These new agreements will aim to establish clear guidelines for the proper ownership and transfer of all intellectual property.</p>
  
  <h4>Protection of Intellectual Property:</h4>
  <p>During the transition period, all intellectual property will be safeguarded through the implementation of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and other relevant legal measures.</p>
  
  <h4>Transfer of Intellectual Property:</h4>
  <p>Upon the completion of the transition process, the transfer of relevant intellectual property will be executed according to the contractual agreements in place. This may involve transferring ownership to the new contractor, the customer, or retaining it with the incumbent, as stipulated in the agreements.</p>
  
  <p>By adhering to these steps, Fleeky Curtains can ensure a smooth and secure transition of all intellectual property associated with the project. This approach will mitigate the risk of IP-related issues and facilitate a successful transition process.</p>

  <h4>User Account Inventory:</h4>
  <p>Create a comprehensive inventory of all user accounts, including internal and external users. This inventory should specify the associated privileges and roles of each account. Identify accounts that are no longer active or necessary for the system.</p>
  
  <h4>Password Security:</h4>
  <p>Prioritize security during the transition by resetting or disabling all user passwords. Notify users to change their passwords to a temporary password provided by the transition team. Once the transition is complete, require users to create new, secure passwords to enhance system security.</p>
  
  <h4>Account Transition and Disablement:</h4>
  <p>Determine which accounts will be transitioned to the new system and which accounts should be disabled. Assign responsible individuals to oversee the transfer of accounts and passwords. Develop clear procedures for disabling accounts of terminated employees, contractors, or third-party vendors to revoke their access rights promptly.</p>
  
  <h4>Table of User Accounts:</h4>
  <p>Provide a table detailing all user accounts involved in the transition. Include the username, associated roles, and privileges. This table will act as a reference document during the transition process.</p>
  
  <h4>User Communication and Training:</h4>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Fleeky Hub aims to provide a system for Fleeky Curtains.</p>
  
  <p>The risk management plan encompasses the roles and responsibilities of the project team, the risk assessment plan, and an outline of the risk management process. It will also detail the procedures for monitoring and managing risks, as well as the tactics for responding to risks. The plan's efficacy will be evaluated based on the prompt identification and resolution of threats.</p>
  
  <h3>Information for Developing a Risk Management Plan for Fleeky Hub:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Identifying Risk: Fleeky Hub development, implementation, and operation project group ought to be aware of any potential dangers. Risks may appear from a number of different places, including technical problems, legal requirements, cybersecurity, and human factors. Risks should be identified and then evaluated for both chance of occurrence and potential effects on the project.</li>
    <li>Risk Monitoring: Risk management is an ongoing activity that needs regular observation and evaluation. To guarantee that risk management procedures are still effective, risks are updated, and new risks are discovered, the project team should establish a frequent review process. All stakeholders should be informed of any changes during the review process, which should be open and transparent.</li>
    <li>Contingency Plans: The project team needs to create backup plans for major risks that could have a big impact on the project's success. Plans for alternatives ought to specify the actions needed to lessen the risk's effects and keep the project moving forward. As the project develops and new risks are discovered, these strategies should be periodically reviewed and modified.</li>
    <li>Risk Mitigation Tactics: The project team should create a plan for minimizing or avoiding the risks after having identified and assessed the risks. Prioritizing mitigation tactics should be done in accordance with how well they reduce risk and how easily they can be implemented in terms of both time and money. Contingency planning, redundancy, risk transfer through insurance, and the creation of fallback processes are some possible strategies.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The Fleeky Hub project team will guarantee the efficient execution of the project, meeting all objectives and mitigating potential risks by incorporating additional considerations into a risk management plan.</p>
  
  <h3>Top Three Risks</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Fleeky Hub would not synchronize the data/information of the patient being recorded if the internet connection is disrupted and/or lost during the process.</li>
    <li>The information cannot be transferred/exchanged safely if the internet connection is lost and if there was a problem/issue that unexpectedly occurs with the router that connects the devices together.</li>
    <li>The data of Fleeky Hub can be vulnerable to risks when it comes to unauthorized personnel since the customer’s personal data can be interacted by the employees.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Risk Management Approach</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Risk Identification and Assessment: Through brainstorming sessions, studies of prior project experiences, and evaluation of the project's requirements and scope, the project team will identify project-related threats. The risks will be listed in a risk register together with details about their likelihood of happening, potential effects, and description. The identified risks will be assessed in terms of their likelihood of occurring and their effect on the project's objectives and plans.</li>
    <li>Risk Response Planning: For each identified risk, the project team will develop a detailed risk response plan. The response strategies may include avoiding, transferring, mitigating, or accepting the risk. The risk response plan will outline the actions to be taken, the parties responsible for executing them, and the timeline for completion. The plan will also include provisions for monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the risk responses.</li>
    <li>Risk Monitoring and Control: The project team will establish a process for ongoing monitoring and control of risks. This will involve regular review of the risk register, tracking the progress of risk response actions, and identifying any new risks that may arise during the project. The project team will also evaluate the effectiveness of risk responses and make adjustments as necessary.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Risk Identification</h3>
  <p>During a risk assessment meeting, the project team and key stakeholders were tasked with identifying and assessing potential risks that could impact the success of the project. The identified risks were then documented in a risk registry. In order to identify additional hazards and develop mitigation strategies, the project team also examined historical data from similar projects. Additionally, experts were consulted and questioned about their experiences in developing similar systems to uncover any additional risks and devise appropriate mitigation plans.</p>
  
  <h3>Potential Risks for Fleeky Hub</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Human Error: Errors made by project team members, having the potential of having an influence on the project.</li>
    <li>Security Vulnerabilities: The initiative runs the risk of being exposed to security lapses or data loss, both of which might have dire repercussions.</li>
    <li>Unforeseen Circumstances: There is a chance that unanticipated events (such market shifts) could have an unexpected effect on the project.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Risk Qualification and Prioritization</h3>
  <p>The project team will regularly review and update the risk record to ensure that risks are prioritized appropriately. The risks mentioned in the risk records were classified and evaluated using a probability-impact matrix. Risks that would have a significant effect on the project and a high possibility of occurring were given top consideration. The following is an overview of the likelihood of risks and their effects on the project:</p>
  
   <h4>Extreme</h4>
  <p>Risks that could seriously harm the project and have a very high possibility of happening.</p>
  
  <h4>High</h4>
  <p>Risks that could have a big impact on the project and have a high chance of happening. The team must immediately address these risks and create mitigation plans for them.</p>
  
  <h4>Medium</h4>
  <p>Risks that have an average chance of happening and a fair impact on the project. In order to prepare for these risks, mitigation plans should be created, and these risks should be continuously monitored.</p>
  
  <h4>Low</h4>
  <p>Risks that have a small impact on the project and a low likelihood of occurring. Periodically monitoring these risks will allow for the development of mitigation plans in case they occur.</p>
  
  <h4>Negligible</h4>
  <p>Risks that have little chance of happening and little effect on the project. These dangers can be disregarded.</p>
  
  <h3>Risk Monitoring</h3>
  <p>The Fleeky Hub Agile Risk Management Plan offers a framework for actively tracking risks throughout the project. To do this, it is crucial to closely document the process, including defining the circumstances that might trigger risks, and to regularly monitor risks during the course of the project.</p>
  
  <p>The high-scoring risks will be incorporated into the project schedule, and the risk manager will be given responsibility for their monitoring. This will make it easier for the project manager to decide when hazards need to be closely monitored and when the risk manager should provide project team meetings with updates. The risk manager will be in charge of monitoring the risk trigger circumstances. The project manager will also make sure that the project team is informed of the risks that have been identified and their potential effects on the project. Any new risks or modifications to existing risks should be reported to the risk management by the project team so that they can be evaluated and given the appropriate level of priority.</p>
  
  <p>The agile risk management methodology, which emphasizes flexibility and constant improvement, will be used by the project team. To guarantee that the project's goals and quality standards are met, the effectiveness of the risk management plan will be periodically evaluated and changed as necessary.</p>
  
  <h3>Risk Mitigation and Avoidance</h3>
  <p>The project team will develop the risk management plan based on the value that each risk is given. The first stage in risk mitigation and avoidance is to identify and prioritize the potential risks. Strategies to prepare for likely delays could include preparing backup plans, allocating more resources, or changing project deadlines. The project team should determine which risks have the highest likelihood and potential impact and then establish plans to reduce or eliminate those risks. The project manager has the following main factors and choices to think about:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Resource Allocation: The project manager must make sure the team has the necessary resources, including competence, abilities, and expertise, as well as access to tools and equipment, in order for the project to be effective and efficient.</li>
    <li>Risk Assessment: To effectively estimate and handle potential hazards, the team should do a detailed analysis of them. Early in the project, the risk assessment should be finished, and the project manager should move quickly to identify and reduce any potential risks.</li>
    <li>Contingency Planning: The project team must develop backup plans for emergencies in order to be ready for potential dangers.</li>
    <li>Agile Approach: Risk management can be done in a flexible and quick manner by using the Agile methodology.</li>
    <li>Communication: The project manager must encourage open and transparent communication between the project team, clients, and stakeholders to reduce risks and avoid misunderstandings.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Risk Register</h3>
  <p>Each risk, its likelihood, potential repercussions, and any mitigation steps will be fully explained in the risk register, which will be maintained current throughout the project. The risk register will be reviewed and updated frequently to make sure it accurately reflects the state of the project at the present time. The risk registry, which will be stored in a central location, will be accessible to all stakeholders.</p>
  
  <p>This risk management strategy is often in line with the Agile methodology and places an emphasis on early and frequent risk discovery, collaborative risk management, and continuing risk monitoring. The risk register will be based on the following standards:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Risk ID - Each risk will receive a special identification number.</li>
    <li>Risk Description - The risk event will be clearly and concisely described.</li>
    <li>Risk Category - Risks will be categorized as technical, organizational, or legal.</li>
    <li>Risk Owner - Will be in charge of keeping an eye on and managing every risk.</li>
    <li>Probability - On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 denoting the lowest chance and 5 denoting the highest, the likelihood of a risk occurring is evaluated.</li>
    <li>Impact - On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents the least significant impact and 5 represents the most significant impact, the risk's potential impact on the project is evaluated.</li>
    <li>Risk Score - For the purpose of calculating the overall risk score, the likelihood and impact scores are compounded.</li>
    <li>Mitigation Strategy - Explains the precise steps that must be done to reduce the risk.</li>
    <li>Status - The current state of the risk, including whether it is open, ongoing, or closed, is also recorded.</li>
    <li>Target Resolution Date - Predicted day that the risk will be resolved.</li>

The goal is to ensure that the Fleeky Hub meets the highest quality standards, and that all quality assurance metrics are closely monitored to ensure the project's success.</p>

  <h2>Quality Control</h2>

  <p>In Agile and Scrum methodology, quality control is embedded into the development process, and the focus is on continuous testing and quality feedback. The Quality Control process for the Fleeky Hub project will involve the following steps:</p>

  <h3>Continuous testing and feedback:</h3>
  <p>The project team will perform continuous testing to identify defects and ensure that the product is meeting customer requirements. The testing will be automated wherever possible, and the results will be tracked in a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) system.</p>

  <h3>User Acceptance Testing (UAT):</h3>
  <p>A representative group of end users will test the system to ensure it satisfies their needs and expectations. The UAT will be performed at the end of each sprint, and any necessary modifications will be made based on feedback from the users.</p>

  <h3>Compatibility Testing:</h3>
  <p>The Fleeky Hub will be tested on multiple platforms, including mobile devices and browsers, to ensure compatibility and address any difficulties that may arise when the system is used in various settings.</p>

  <h3>Continuous Monitoring:</h3>
  <p>After deployment, the project team will monitor the effectiveness of the Fleeky Hub. This will involve keeping an eye on important performance measures including user happiness, response time, and system uptime. This will provide essential information to aid with any system upgrades and identify any problems or bottlenecks.</p>

  <h2>Quality Metrics for Monitoring</h2>

  <p>The following quality metrics will be used to monitor and assess the system's performance:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Defect Density: The number of defects found per unit of measure (e.g., per KLOC)</li>
    <li>Defect Severity: The classification of defects based on their impact on the system.</li>
    <li>Test Coverage: The percentage of the system that has been tested.</li>
    <li>Test Case Pass Rate: The percentage of test cases that have been passed.</li>
    <li>User Happiness: Measured through surveys and feedback from users.</li>
    <li>Response Time: The time taken for the system to respond to user requests.</li>
    <li>System Uptime: The percentage of time the system is available and functioning as expected.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tracking and Documenting Quality Evaluations</h2>

  <p>The project team will track and document the outcomes of the Quality Control process, which will be used to monitor the project's progress and the effectiveness of any remedial actions that are taken.</p>

  <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>

  <p>The Quality Control process will be reviewed frequently, seeking opportunities for improvement, and implementing them as necessary.</p>

  <h2>Quality Control Measurements</h2>

  <p>The Agile and Scrum techniques will be employed to promote continuous inspection and modification throughout the project lifecycle for the Fleeky Hub project, which will adopt a transparent and collaborative approach to quality control.</p>

  <p>To guarantee that the product fulfills the standards and criteria, quality control measures will be made at each stage of the development process and documented on a shared, viewable platform, such as a project management tool, as opposed to a static spreadsheet or table.</p>

  <p>The following details will be on the platform:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Measurement date</li>
    <li>Measurement type (e.g., automated testing, code review, peer review, user story acceptance)</li>
    <li>The measurement's findings (such as passed/failed, the number of flaws discovered, and the percentage of code coverage)</li>
    <li>Requirements and standards for comparison</li>
    <li>Member of the team in charge of measuring</li>
    <li>Team member responsible for assessing the measurement results</li>
    <li>Taking any required corrective actions</li>
    <li>The date that the remedial measures were finished</li>
    <li>Team member in charge of carrying out corrective measures</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Dashboards and other visual tools will be used to track the quality control measurements in real-time so that all team members can readily access and comprehend the data. The dashboards will draw attention to patterns and problem areas so that the team can act fast and make the necessary adjustments.</p>

  <p>The quality control metrics will be reviewed, and the method will be adjusted as necessary during routine team reviews such as sprint reviews and retrospectives. Together, the group will pinpoint potential improvement areas and put any found problems into practice.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>In conclusion, the Fleeky Hub project will use Agile and Scrum approaches to implement a collaborative and dynamic quality control strategy. To make sure the product satisfies the standards and needs, the team will regularly assess the product's quality and make the required improvements. On a common platform, all quality control measurements will be collected and tracked in real-time. The team will collaborate to address any problems and implement any necessary improvements.</p>

 <h1>Change Management Plan</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>A robust change management plan is of utmost importance for the Fleeky Hub project to ensure its successful execution. This plan provides a structured framework for identifying, evaluating, and implementing changes that may arise throughout the project lifecycle. By following this plan, changes can be effectively managed, ensuring they align with the project's scope and objectives, and are communicated to all stakeholders in a timely manner.</p>

  <p>The change management plan includes a defined process for submitting, evaluating, and approving changes. This process is clearly communicated to all stakeholders, encouraging them to submit any modification requests they may have. The project team then carefully evaluates these requests, considering their potential impact on the project's schedule, cost, and quality. Approved changes are subsequently implemented in a controlled and organized manner, while rejected changes are documented for future reference.</p>

  <p>It is important to emphasize that making changes outside the designated change management process can have negative consequences on the project's progress and ultimate outcome. Therefore, it is crucial for all stakeholders to understand and adhere to the change management process. This adherence will help ensure that the project remains on track and that any changes made contribute to its overall success.</p>

  <p>By having a well-defined change management plan in place, the Fleeky Hub project can effectively address and accommodate modifications, mitigating potential risks and maintaining project stability. This approach fosters transparency, accountability, and effective communication among all stakeholders, ultimately leading to a successful project delivery.</p>

  <h2>Change Control Board</h2>
