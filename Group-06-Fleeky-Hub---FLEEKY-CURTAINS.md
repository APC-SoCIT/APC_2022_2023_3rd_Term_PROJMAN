=Business Case=
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Fleeky Hub is a Local online retailer of curtains and draperies. By offering a wide selection of curtain colors, materials,  and  styles  at  an  affordable  price,  we  aim  to  provide  our  clients  with  an  easy  and  simple purchasing experience. The project proposed will be simple to use and offer each consumer a stress-free buying experience.</p><p>Fleeky Hub's business strategy is based on an online shopping platform such as Shopee, which has seen drastic growth in recent years due to most of businesses transitioning to an online platform as well as the demand  for  online  purchasing.  Online  shopping  has  seen  a  significant  trend  due  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing this upward trend, Fleeky Hub gives clients the ability of purchasing their curtains from the convenience of the clients' respective homes. Our web shop is available 24/7, allowing customers to shop at their convenience. </p>

<h2>Issue</h2>

<p>There were  multiple  issues  that arose  during  the  pandemic  and  post  pandemic  on  the business of Fleeky Curtains, since the employees of the business are all members of the family there are times when some of them have different schedules and personal agendas due to some them are still studying, and this has been a pain point in their business since when there  is  a depletion  in  terms  of  the  staff  the processing  of  orders  and  customer services  would  be  gravely  affected.  Another  problem  of Fleeky Curtains  was  the processing the  clients'  orders,  since they  are using  a  traditional  method  of  manually encoding order information to the system, which becomes a problem since the processing of customer information becomes redundant and time consuming.</p>

<h2>Anticipated Outcomes</h2>

<p>The  outcome  of  the  project  will  help  them open their  market  to  different channels. Having their own domain and their site will lose their dependency to other e-commerce sites which was also stated that they are having challenges in terms of their commission rates as per customer purchase at the e-commerce site. With the help of the project, it will lessen the costs of the business and stabilize production and growth of the sales. This will also be a place to lead the customer in purchasing their likes and needs.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

<p>Add feature that guests customers can also make their purchases at the site rather than creating an account in the first place. It would be better also to add a friendly viewing experience when it is accessed via mobile phone. </p><p>Fleeky Hub's features and functionalities streamline various tasks, automate repetitive processes,  and  provide  tools  for  efficient  management  of  tasks  and  workflows.  As  a result, employees can complete their tasks faster and with increased accuracy, leading to improved productivity and reduced processing time. </p><p>Furthermore,  the  integration  of  Fleeky  Hub  allows  for  the  digitalization  of  manual processes.  The  platform  enables  the  automation  of  tasks  that  were  previously  done manually, such as data entry, scheduling, and reporting. This not only eliminates the risk of errors associated with manual processes but also increases the overall efficiency and accuracy of the operations. The digitalization of processes also enables real-time tracking and  monitoring  of  tasks,  providing  managers  with  better  visibility  and  control  over operations. </p><p>In  addition,  Fleeky  Hub  offers  a  wide  range  of  features  that  can  help  create  a  better working environment for the client's employees. For example, it provides collaboration tools that facilitate communication and coordination among team members, helping to streamline workflows and improve overall team productivity. It also offers reporting and analytics features that provide insights into team performance and allow for data-driven decision   making.   These   features   can   lead   to   a   more   organized,   efficient,   and collaborative working environment for the employees, enhancing their job satisfaction and overall well-being.</p>

<h2>Justification</h2>

<p>Not only the group will provide the platform to its client to help its daily operations, but also to establish a means where the client’s business can invite or encourage other potential  customers  in patronizing their product and  even have the potential  to touch other markets that they previously do not reach for a greater yield. </p><p>As local stores leverage several types of software, social media, and modern technologies to  market  their  products,  integrating  Fleeky  Hub  can  be  the  most  effective  approach. This will centralize the web marketing process for Fleeky Curtains, while also providing an  opportunity  to  utilize  the  features  integrated  by  Fleeky  Hub  to  monitor  customer behavior towards their products. Such monitoring will aid Fleeky Curtains in identifying profitable products and making informed decisions about their production strategy. </p><p>By  integrating  Fleeky  Hub  into  their  marketing  efforts,  Fleeky  Curtains  can  streamline and optimize their online marketing processes. The platform offers a range of features that  can  help  manage  and  track  marketing  campaigns,  analyze  customer  data, and provide valuable insights into customer behavior. This information can be utilized to gain a  deeper  understanding  of  customer  preferences,  purchasing  patterns,  and  product performance. </p><p>With  these  insights,  Fleeky  Curtains  can  make  data-driven  decisions  to  optimize  their production  strategy.  They  can  identify  which  products  are  performing  well  and  adjust their  production  schedule  accordingly.  For  instance,  if  certain  products  are  in  high demand,  Fleeky  Curtains  can  allocate  more  resources  to  produce  them  and  ensure sufficient  stock  is  available.  On  the  other hand, if  certain  products  are  not  performing well, production can be adjusted or discontinued to avoid excess inventory</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>With family members often occupied with their own commitments at work, school, or home, managing a business can become challenging in terms of time management.</p><p> Running  a  business  requires considerable  time and  effort,  including  tasks  such  as marketing,  operations,  finance,  and  customer  management.  However,  when  family members have their own individual responsibilities and schedules to attend to, it can be challenging  to  allocate  sufficient  time  to  the  business.  Competing  priorities  and  busy schedules  may  result  in  limited  availability  to  focus  on  the  business  and  its  various aspects.</p>
<p>Having a limited number of employees means they are bound to achieve less activities:</p>

<p>1. Delayed response to customer inquiries that frequently asks on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Availability (how many products are on-hand)
</li>
<li>
Actual photos of the product.
</li>
<li>
The size and fabric.
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Staffs/employees has difficulties in knowing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If there is any new or ongoing confirmed order.
</li>
<li>
Status update of the ongoing order.
</li>
<li>
The details of the orders.
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Seldomly encodes information as it takes too long to manually record on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sales and expenses
</li>
<li>
Customer information
</li>
<li>
Customer order
</li>
<li>
The availability of raw materials inside the inventory
</li>
</ul>
4. Inconsistent recording of sales and transactions of customers, alongside with its order details and customer information, that leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Inaccurate reading of business profit and loss
</li>
<li>
Unreliable reports
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In summary, while having a limited number of employees can pose challenges in managing business activities, proactive measures such as implementing technology solutions and optimizing processes can help mitigate these challenges and lead to improved productivity and success in the long run.

=Project Charter=
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The pandemic has caused businesses to adapt quickly, using social media platforms such as Facebook and e-commerce platforms to sell their products. Fleeky Curtains is an independent family business that provides curtain products. They operate the business at the local household and book a courier to pick up the item and deliver the item to the customer. They aim to grow their market share in the home product industry by observing and adapting to the behavior of the consumers. The employees in the business consist of the members of the family where they take charge of the sewing, assemble the packaging, the messages at Facebook, Shopee inquiries, product inspection, and one that list and encode transactions and customer information. Despite having a limited number of employees, the business wishes to accomplish tasks at an efficient rate due to the lack of workforce/person. The most important details in this text are the production time, packaging time, encoding time, number of products and raw materials, inquiries, available products, expanding the potential clients, and the staff. Fleeky Curtains mentioned that when there is no assistant, the staff finishes the tasks behind time, and that handling and assembling the packaging of one customer order takes 25 minutes of their time. Additionally, the staff must cope with their sleep and roles at work or school, and they must adapt to the market. Fleeky Curtains is an e-commerce company that uses a variety of materials to produce their products. Raw materials such as fabrics, threads, grommet, and curtain rings are used to build a finish product, and packaging materials such as bubble wrap are used to cover the products. Spending activities are traced and recorded within an Excel sheet, and customer data is stored in an Excel sheet. Customer data helps them to identify customer behavior and consumerism, and user experience is most observed when presented with convenience. They have gained knowledgeable feedback and experience revolving to their current system and workflows. Spotlight interviewed one of the admins that handle Fleeky Curtains, Mr. Neil Albert Garcia, to discuss their pain points when it comes to handling their business. These include fees and expenses to the e-commerce platform, poor delivery system, manual encoding of customer details, raw materials and on-hand stocks not documented and audited, finding ways to expand their clients and markets, and manual reports and tracing the performance of the business. These inputs will help align the project with the client's needs and interests. </p>

<h2>Project Purpose/Justification</h2>

<p>The existing system may be improved by implementing contemporary technology, moving to a better design, and allowing administrators to quickly monitor operations, inventory, and activity. Fleeky Hub will also help employees complete their responsibilities more quickly by tracking departing orders, understanding what has to be packed, what needs to be prepared, what inventories are available, and encoding client information. Prospective company owners, particularly those with small firms, can benefit from Project Akbay's efficiency features, which will allow them to handle orders more quickly and monitor their operations. The relevance of the project for developers, future researchers, company owners, administrators, and employees is that it will provide them with a better grasp of how to design, improve, and execute a stronger basis for their product. Objectives for Sustainable Development (SDGs SDG 8 to increase economic productivity and SDG 9 to develop and promote innovative technology both complement the initiative. The use of the product and the recording of the study will help future studies and offer a better answer for those in need.</p>

<h2>Business Need/Case</h2>

<p>To manage the online business, a robust digital tool is needed to reduce the staff's role in the processes involved at encoding and operations. Adapting to technology can resolve challenges quickly and enable the staff to finish quickly at their role and finish other agendas.

They also handle customer inquiries at Facebook and leave their booking information at the chat. The employees of Fleeky Curtains extend their work for the customer by creating order and courier booking for the customer. They also encode customer details at Excel and record the product that he/she purchased and its value, quantity, and type of product. </p>

<h2>Business Objectives</h2>

Technical limits: Fleeky Curtains may suffer technological constraints such as restricted access to certain technologies or limitations in the available resources, hardware or software.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<p>In creating a website for Fleeky Curtains, targeting the customers and their market should be considered on the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	Consumers will be interested in buying curtains online and will trust the website to deliver high-quality items and customer service. 
    </li>
	<li>
	There is a substantial market demand for curtains and window coverings to meet the website's business strategy and revenue targets. 
	</li>
	<li>
	When compared to other online and physical merchants, the website will be able to provide comparable prices. 
	</li>
	<li>
	The website will have access to a trustworthy and cost-effective supply chain for obtaining curtains from manufacturers and suppliers. 
	</li>
	<li>
	The website will be able to recruit and keep a strong team of web developers, designers, and marketing specialists to establish and operate the website.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Preliminary Scope Statement</h2>

<p>The scope of this project is to develop a website that helps the employees of Fleeky Curtains manage their customers, and their orders, by redirecting them to make purchases at the site. The main scope is for businesses to be able to address staff's challenges at their tasks and cater to their customers in an efficient way. The project also aims to aid the efficiency for businesses that do their ordering systems manually, enabling to increase the business' efficiency in handling continuous orders and documenting transactions and information seamlessly. The group will be looking to become a website to reduce the staff's time in handling customer inquiries on the products and direct the customer to order inside the website, as well as to navigate according to the customer liking and put the business in a leading edge compared to its competitors. </p>

<h2>Risks</h2>

<p>There are several business risks linked with selling curtains online. A curtain firm may encounter the following risks, which are among of the most frequent:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	Cybersecurity risks: Internet commerce platforms are susceptible to assaults that might lead to the loss of confidential consumer information or interfere with daily operations. To secure their data and client information, businesses must make sure they have proper security measures in place. 
	</li>
	<li>
	Logistics and shipping: To deliver their goods, online selling platforms must rely on logistics and shipping partners. Inaccuracies or delays in the shipping procedure might lead to missing or damaged goods, unhappy customers, and perhaps lost sales. 
	</li>
        <li>
	Reputation risks: Include negative customer experiences like subpar products, delayed delivery, or bad customer service. Negative criticism may be amplified through social media and online review platforms, therefore it's critical for businesses to actively manage their online reputation. 
	</li>
        <li>
	Pricing and competition: The internet marketplace may be quite competitive, with numerous merchants providing the same things at various price points. To preserve profitability while still being competitive, businesses must control their pricing strategy. 
	</li>
        <li>
	Technical risks: Online selling platforms depend on technology to run, and problems with that technology can cost businesses money and make customers unhappy. To reduce the risk of technical difficulties, businesses must have a strong technological infrastructure.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>To guarantee the long-term viability of their business, Fleeky Curtains must evaluate and reduce these risks. A curtains company can lessen the potential negative impact on their business and customers and position themselves for success in the online selling space by putting measures in place to manage these risks, such as investing in cybersecurity, working with reputable logistics and shipping providers, offering top-notch customer service, and complying with legal and regulatory requirements.</p>

<h1>Cost Management Plan</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In Fleeky Curtains, the management and the employees are responsible for keeping the business running. Since the client is a small business handled by the family members, each of the decisions and budget planning is in the scope of the family members. The investor and the founder of Fleeky Curtains is the one who finances the business, Mitzi Garcia. She also oversees which products to be invested and the raw materials to supplement the production of curtains. The investor also has the authority to approve the changes to the project of Fleeky Hub and carrying out the budget for the business and the project</p>

<p>On the other note, the manager Neil Albert Garcia does the administrative tasks and manages the accounting for the transactions and expenses for the business. The manager also oversees the operations.</p>


<p>Cost Management Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Project Manager will be responsible for overall cost management of the project and will be the primary point of contact for all cost-related issues.
</li>
<li>
The Finance Team will be responsible for monitoring project costs and ensuring that they are within the approved budget.
</li>


<p>Cost Change Approval:</p>

<li>
All cost changes must be approved by the Project Manager before they are implemented.
</li>
<li>
If the cost change exceeds 10% of the total project budget, it must be approved by the Project Sponsor before it can be implemented.
</li>

<p>Cost Measurement and Reporting:</p>

<li>
Costs will be measured and reported monthly, using a cost performance index (CPI) and a schedule of performance index (SPI)
</li>
<li>
Reports will be presented to the Project Sponsors monthly.
</li>

<p>Budget Format and Standards:</p>

<li>
The Budget will be presented in a clear and concise format, using a spreadsheet format such as Excel and Fleeky Hub’s Website feature (If implemented/upon agreement)
</li>
<li>
The budget will be broken down into individual line items, with detailed cost estimates for each item.
</li>
<li>
The budget will be updated monthly, with any changes clearly highlighted
</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the Cost Management Plan for the Fleeky Hub project is designed to ensure that all costs associated with the project are effectively managed and controlled, so that the project can be completed within the approved budget. This will help ensure that the project is completed successfully and on time.</p>


<h2>Cost Management Approach</h2>

<p>The Cost Management approach for the dispatch directory system project will be based on the following principles</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Clear definitions of costs: The project team will work closely with stakeholders to clearly define and document the cost associated with the project, including development, materials, tools, API, and other expenses that are included within the project development contract agreement.
</li>
<li>
Budget development tracking: A detailed project budget will be developed and regularly updated throughout the project, with costs tracked and reported in real time.
</li>
<li>
Cost estimates: The project team will use a variety of cost estimation techniques to ensure that the project budget is accurate and realistic.
</li>
<li>
Cost variance analysis: The project team will closely monitor costs throughout the project and perform variance analysis to identify and address any cost overruns or savings.
</li>
<li>
Cost management roles and responsibilities: Clear roles and responsibilities for cost management will be defined and communicated to all project team members
</li>
<li>
Approval process for changes: A formal process for approving changes to the project or its budget will be established and implemented.
</li>
<li>
Reporting and communication: Regular cost reports will be prepared and shared with stakeholders, including the project sponsor, project team, and management.
</li>
</ol>

<p>By following these principles and practices, the project team will be able to effectively manage costs and ensure that the project stays on budget.</p>

<h2>Measuring Project Costs</h2>

<p>The Cost Management Plan for the Fleeky Hub project will include a detailed approach for measuring project cost using Earned Value Management (EVM). This will involve capturing and reporting on various Earned Value metrics, such as:</p>

<p>1.    Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) – These measures the budgeted costs of the work that was planned to be completed at a specific point of time.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p>To calculate the BCWS or Planned Value, we need to multiply the total labor cost of the TESTING WBS by its percentage of completion:</p>
<p>BCWS</p>

<p>= Total labor cost of TESTING WBS x Percentage of completion</p>

<p>= (PHP 25,000) x 33.71%</p>

<p>= PHP 8,427.50</p>

<p>Therefore, the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) for the TESTING WBS is PHP 8,427.50</p>


<h2>Reporting Format</h2>

<p>Reporting for cost management will be included in the monthly project status report. The Monthly Project Status Report will include a section labeled, “Cost Management”. This section will contain the Earned Value Metrics identified in the previous section. All cost variances outside of the thresholds identified in this Cost Management Plan will be reported on including any corrective actions which are planned. Change Requests which are triggered based upon project cost overruns will be identified and tracked in this report.</p>

</li>
<li>
The domain name and hosting for the website is to be subscribed to Linode for two dollars per month and we increased the allotted budget for the whole year.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost Variance Response Process</h2>

<p>The Cost Variance Response process for ADENICSY project will be as follows:</p>
<p>1. Control Thresholds:<br>
 - Several control criteria for cost variation will be specified for the project.<br>
 - These limits will be 3%, 7%, and 10% of the project's overall budget.<br>
 - The project will be deemed to have a cost variance if any of these criteria are reached.</p>

<p>2. Identification of Variance:<br>
 - The Project Manager oversees locating any cost variations and informing the Project Sponsor about them.<br>
 - To find and monitor any variations, the project manager will make use of earned value metrics and other cost management tools.</p>

<p>3. Analysis of Variance:<br>
 - To pinpoint the source of the issue and provide choices for remedial action, the project manager will examine the deviation.<br>
 - The project manager will also take into account how the deviation may affect the project's scope and timeline.</p>

<p>4. Presentation of Options:<br>
 - The project manager will give the project sponsor a presentation on the possibilities for remedial action.<br>
 - The choices will depend on the underlying reason for the deviation and how it affects the project's scope and timeline.</p>

<p>5. Approval of Corrective Action:<br>
 - After considering the available choices, the project sponsor will decide on a course of action to get the project back on track.<br>
 - This can entail raising the budget, lowering the scope or quality, or taking other remedial measures.</p>

<p>6. Implementation of Corrective Action:<br>
 - The project manager will put the agreed corrective action into practice and keep an eye on the outcomes.<br>
 - The project manager will also make the necessary updates to the budget and timeline.</p>

<p>7. Reporting:<br>
 - In the monthly project status report, the project manager will note any cost variances, remedial actions performed, and their outcomes.<br>
 - The project manager will also give updates on the budget and timeline for the project.</p>

<p>Throughout the course of the project, the Cost Variance Response procedure will be active. The Project Sponsor will oversee authorizing any necessary remedial steps, while the Project Manager will be in charge of monitoring and regulating the project expenditures.</p>

<h2>Cost Change Control Process</h2>

<p>The cost change control process will follow the established project change request process. Approvals for project budget/cost changes must be approved by the project sponsor</p>

<h2>Project Budget</h2>
<p>The budget for this project is detailed below.  Costs for this project are presented in various categories...</p>
