=Business Case=
==Executive Summary==
==Issue==
<p>At the Apelo Dental Clinic currently, traditional techniques are employed to conduct business operations, including the utilization of index cards for patient data, and writing numbers on paper to schedule appointments. Patients arrive at the clinic as early as 4 in the morning to obtain a queue number, which will give them a better chance of being seen earlier. However, the clinic only commences its operations at 9 in the morning. Since patient information and payment records are both kept on index cards, some records of other patients cannot be found. In each of the processes implemented in Apelo Dental Clinic, patients and clinic staff encounter difficulties or challenges. </p>
