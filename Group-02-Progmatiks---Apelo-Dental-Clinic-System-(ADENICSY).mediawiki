=Company Profile=
<p>Apelo Dental Clinic (ADC) is located in Dr Arcadio Santos Ave, Parañaque City established in 2001. Their mission is to provide quality service with affordable price, so no one is deprived of good oral health care and their vision is to continuously upgrade to deliver highest dental care in safe environment for life-long. With their mission and vision, they were able to accumulate many patients that keeps coming back to the clinic for their service.
</p>
=Business Case=
==Executive Summary==
==Issue==
<p>At the Apelo Dental Clinic currently, traditional techniques are employed to conduct business operations, including the utilization of index cards for patient data, and writing numbers on paper to schedule appointments. Patients arrive at the clinic as early as 4 in the morning to obtain a queue number, which will give them a better chance of being seen earlier. However, the clinic only commences its operations at 9 in the morning. Since patient information and payment records are both kept on index cards, some records of other patients cannot be found. In each of the processes implemented in Apelo Dental Clinic, patients and clinic staff encounter difficulties or challenges. </p>
==Anticipated Outcomes==
<p>The project anticipated outcomes of an efficient web application namely Apelo Dental Clinic System (ADENICSY) by the end of June 2023. The implementation will take place within the company's intranet, utilizing the existing records. The proposed system should include 6 major functionalities for account management of patients and employees, queuing management, search function, dental records and payment records management, and dashboard. 

The execution of the proposed project will lead to an enhanced user experience at Apelo Dental Clinic by reducing waiting time and preventing the loss of patient data. The need to physically go to the clinic to obtain a queue number and inquire about the current serving number will be eliminated. The digitalization of patient data will enable the Dental Clinic to retrieve patient information quickly and prevent the excessive use of physical space. Additionally, the system will allow patients to access their payment records for services received and view their remaining balance.
</p>
==Recommendation==
<p>
As a solution to the issues that are listed, it is recommended to Apelo Dental Clinic combine all the functionalities. The project can alleviate the main pain points, which are the long waiting time for patients, and the loss of medical records of the patients. It is concluded in our interview with the patients of the clinic that having a poor queuing system is the main pain point of the clinic. 

As the team has plans on scaling in the future, it is also high time to transition from a traditional technique to a technology-ready clinic. Old data of the patients that are stored in the index cards will be transferred to each of their accounts, which means there will be fewer manual actions needed from the patient’s end.
</p>
==Justification==
<p>The Apelo Dental Clinic System is a much-needed solution for dental clinics facing challenges with manual processes, including long waiting times and the risk of losing patient records. Our system provides a digital platform to automate queueing and record-keeping, enabling clinics to increase efficiency, improve patient experience and reduce costs. With our system, patients can easily view their queueing status online, and clinics can maintain accurate and secure patient records without the risk of losing them.

The implementation of the Apelo Dental Clinic System is a worthwhile investment for dental clinics. The system will provide significant benefits, including reducing waiting times and errors, improving patient satisfaction and retention, and increasing the overall productivity of the clinic. By embracing digital technology, clinics can save time and costs, reduce manual errors, and improve the quality of patient care. Ultimately, the Apelo Dental Clinic System can lead to a more streamlined and efficient clinic operation, benefiting both patients and dental practitioners.

==Problem Definition==
<p> <b>Problem Statement</b></p>
<p>Apelo Dental Clinic is a company that provides a wide range of dental services to its customers. Usually, they focus on preserving good oral hygiene and avoiding or addressing dental problems. However, Apelo Dental Clinic System (ADENICSY) is a web application that supports day to day operation of Apelo Dental Clinic. 

The company employs manual procedures for its daily operations, which involve using paper-based systems for queuing management and index cards to keep track of patient data. This results in a delay of approximately 1 to 4 hours to obtain a number, and patient information retrieval is time-consuming and occupies significant space in the dental clinic. All the current manual procedures are vulnerable to human mistakes and data loss. Despite efforts to maintain a large amount of data, some are still lost, and patients experience excessive waiting times, making it difficult for the company to maintain all the data of their patients and accommodate all the patients in their dental clinic.</p>

<p><b>Organizational Impact</b></p>
<p>The implementation of Apelo Dental Clinic will have a significant impact on the company. By reducing long waiting times in queuing and improving the manual process of recording records, the clinic can redirect its savings toward other important initiatives.

=Stakeholder Management Strategy=
==Introduction==
<p>The goal of the stakeholder management strategy for the project is to effectively engage and manage the expectations of all stakeholders throughout the project life cycle. This includes identifying and analyzing stakeholder needs and interests, developing a communication plan to keep stakeholders informed and engaged, and managing stakeholder expectations to ensure that the project delivers value and meets the needs of all stakeholders.</p>

<p>In addition, this stakeholder management plan for Apelo Dental Clinic Management System (ADENICSY) will ensure that the needs and expectations of all stakeholders are considered and balanced in the design and operation of the system. This includes ensuring that the system is effective and efficient in meeting the needs of its users, as well as being responsive to the concerns and feedback of stakeholders such as the owner, the dentists, the staffs, and the Patients. The objectives of this strategy are to:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Identify all key stakeholders and their level of interest in the project.</li>
   <li>Analyze the needs and expectations of each stakeholder group.</li>
   <li>Develop a communication plan to keep stakeholders informed and engaged throughout the project.</li>
   <li>Identify and manage potential conflicts or competing objectives among stakeholders.</li>
   <li>Ensure that the project delivers value and meets the needs of all stakeholders.</li>
   <li>Establish a system for ongoing stakeholder engagement and feedback to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the stakeholder management plan and ensure that the project remains aligned with stakeholder needs and expectations.</li>
   <li>Involving the stakeholders in the planning and decision–making process to help ensure that the concerns of the stakeholders are all considered.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Some potential strategies for a ADENICSY to have better stakeholder management could include:</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Improving communication and transparency:</b> It can help improve communication between different stakeholders, such as dentists, patients, and staffs providing one repository for information reducing the chance of illegible records and patients can see their account transactions anytime and verifying their payments real-time.</li>
   <li><b>Increasing efficiency:</b>  The clinic currently uses an index card to record their patient records that are stored in a tray. ADENICSY can omit the use of index cards, also removing the need for retrieval of index cards which sometimes get lost.</li>
   <li><b>Improving customer experience:</b> Patients will be able to get their queueing number in ADENICSY, eliminating the need to go to the clinic early in the morning and go back when their queuing number is near. They will also be able to track the current number in the clinic in real-time allowing them to estimate their arrival in the clinic, reducing the waiting time to get operated. </li>
   <li><b>Enhancing decision-making:</b> ADENICSY provides dashboard to the owner insights from the clinic’s operation data such as the number of customers that has served throughout the day, how much is the doctor to patient ratio, how long is the handling time of a certain procedure, which day of the month does a peak in patient occurs and more. This will enable the owner to have a better understanding of what’s happening in the clinic and aid him in better decision-making.</li>
</ul>

==Identify Stakeholders==
<p>The goal of the Stakeholder Management Strategy for the ADENICSY project is to ensure that all stakeholders are identified, their interests and influence on the project are understood, and their needs and expectations are effectively managed. In other words, the aim of the stakeholder management strategy for ADENICSY is to identify and engage with all individuals or groups that have a personal stake in the project and will be impacted by its implementation or success. To achieve this, the project team will follow a structured methodology to identify stakeholders. This will involve conducting interviews with key personnel, reviewing relevant documents and data sources, and engaging with various stakeholders through focus groups and other consultation processes.</p>
<p>To identify its stakeholders, a structured method can be used which involves:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Identifying all potential stakeholders through a stakeholder analysis. This includes. identifying internal stakeholders (such as employees and management) and external stakeholders (such as customers, suppliers, and regulatory bodies).</li>
   <li>Prioritizing stakeholders based on their level of influence, power, and impact on the project. This will help determine how much time and resources should be allocated. towards engaging with each stakeholder.</li>
   <li>Developing a stakeholder engagement plan to outline how each stakeholder will be engaged and communicated with throughout the project.</li>
   <li>Maintaining ongoing communication with stakeholders to ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed and that the project stays on track.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Stakeholders will be defined as any individuals or groups who have an interest in or are impacted by the project, such as employees, customers (Technicians and Managers), Management team, and/or other organizational team members. The project team will use a stakeholder analysis tool to categorize stakeholders based on their level of interest and influence and will develop tailored communication and engagement plans for each stakeholder group. This will help to ensure that all stakeholders are kept informed about the project's progress and are able to provide input and feedback as needed. By effectively managing stakeholders, the project team can build support for the project, address any concerns or issues that may arise, and increase the chances of project success.</p>

==Scope Verification==
<p>To ensure that the deliverables from the Apelo Dental Clinic System project meet the original scope, the project team will utilize a variety of methods for scope verification. These methods may include: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Quality checklist:</b> 
The project team will rely on checklists to ensure that each deliverable meets the required standards before proceeding. These checklists will contain detailed specifications for each deliverable, outlining the specific criteria that must be met for it to be considered acceptable.
</li>
  <li><b>Work performance measurements:</b>
By closely monitoring the development of each deliverable, the project team can ensure that they are staying on track and meeting their objectives. This proactive approach enables the team to catch any problems early on, minimizing the risk of delays or cost overruns and ensuring a successful outcome for the project.
</li>
  <li><b>Scope baseline:</b>
It is crucial for the project team to maintain a scope baseline, which captures the project's original scope. Any modifications to the scope must be formally documented and approved before they are implemented. The scope baseline serves as a reference point to ensure that the final deliverables align with the initial project scope.
</li>
  <li><b>Formal acceptance:</b> 
When a project team completes a deliverable, it is crucial to get formal acceptance from the project sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders. This helps ensure that everyone's expectations are being met and allows for any necessary adjustments to be made promptly, avoiding potential delays and misunderstandings down the line.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it is important that the project team maintains consistent communication and collaboration with the customer and other stakeholders throughout the project to ensure that the deliverables meet the original scope and are formally accepted. </p>

==Scope Control==
<p>As part of the project management process, the project's scope must be carefully controlled to ensure that it remains aligned with the original project objectives. The Project Manager will lead the effort to monitor and evaluate the project's deliverables and progress against the Project Scope Statement. Any deviations from the scope will be thoroughly examined and assessed to determine if changes are necessary. If changes are required, the established scope change process will be followed, with proper documentation and approval procedures in place. The project team and stakeholders will work closely with the Project Manager to ensure that the scope remains within the defined boundaries. Regular reviews will be conducted to assess progress and identify any areas where scope changes may be necessary. The Project Manager will be responsible for communicating any scope changes to all affected parties, ensuring that everyone is aware of any potential impact on the project's timeline or budget.<br>
<br>
The scope control process for the Apelo Dental Clinic System project will involve the following steps in making changes to the scope baseline: </p>
<ol>
  <li>A scope change request will be initiated by any stakeholder or team member who identifies a need for a change to the scope.</li>
  <li>The Project Manager and the Project Sponsor will evaluate the effect of the proposed modifications on the project's schedule, budget, and resources by reviewing the scope change request.</li>
  <li>The Project Manager has the authority to approve or reject change requests that are considered to have minimal impact or significant impact. However, if the change request is classified as low impact and the Project Manager approves or denies it, the Project Sponsor has the option to review and overturn their decision.</li>
  <li>Assuming the request gets approved, the Project Manager will devise a course of action to implement the change, amend the scope baseline, and inform all the pertinent stakeholders about the change.</li>
  <li>Assuming the request gets approved, the Project Manager will devise a course of action to implement the change, amend the scope baseline, and inform all the pertinent stakeholders about the change.</li>
</ol>
<p>To guarantee the project remains within budget and on schedule, it's crucial to establish a structured protocol for modifying the scope baseline. Any modifications to the scope must be scrutinized and authorized with care to prevent scope creep and maintain project progress.</p>


=Cost Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Cost Management Plan for Apelo Dental Clinic System (ADENICSY) project is designed to ensure that all costs associated with the project are effectively managed throughout its lifecycle. The plan outlines the format and standards by which the project costs will be measured, reported, and controlled.

<br><br>Cost management responsibilities:

<ul>
  <li>The Project Manager will be responsible for overall cost management of the project and will be the primary point of contact for all cost-related issues.</li>
  <li>The Finance Team will be responsible for monitoring project costs and ensuring that they are within the approved budget.</li>
</ul>

Cost change approval:
<ul>
  <li>All cost changes must be approved by the Project Manager before they are implemented.</li>
  <li>If the cost change exceeds 10% of the total project budget, it must be approved by the Project Sponsor before it can be implemented.</li>
</ul>

Cost measurement and reporting:
<ul>
  <li>Costs will be measured and reported on a monthly basis, using a cost performance index (CPI) and a schedule performance index (SPI).</li>
  <li>Reports will be presented to the Project Sponsor on a monthly basis.</li>
</ul>

Budget format and standards:
<ul>
  <li>The budget will be presented in a clear and concise format, using a spreadsheet format such as Excel.</li>
  <li>The budget will be broken down into individual line items, with detailed cost estimates for each item.</li>
  <li>The budget will be updated on a monthly basis, with any changes clearly highlighted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the Cost Management Plan for ADENICSY project is designed to ensure that all costs associated with the project are effectively managed and controlled, so that the project can be completed within the approved budget. This will help ensure that the project is completed successfully and on time.

==Cost Management Approach==
<p>The cost management approach for the dispatch directory system project will be based on the following principles:
</p>
<br>
<p>
a.	Clear definition of costs:
-	The project team will work closely with stakeholders to clearly define and document the costs associated with the project, including labor, materials, equipment, and other expenses.
<br>
<br>
b.	Budget development and tracking:
-	A detailed project budget will be developed and regularly updated throughout the project, with costs tracked and reported in real time.
<br>
<br>
c.	Cost estimates:
-	The project team will use a variety of cost estimation techniques to ensure that the project budget is accurate and realistic.
<br>
<br>
d.	Cost variance analysis:
-	The project team will closely monitor costs throughout the project and perform variance analysis to identify and address any cost overruns or savings.
<br>
<br>
e.	Cost management roles and responsibilities:
-	Clear roles and responsibilities for cost management will be defined and communicated to all project team members.
<br>
<br>
f.	Approval process for changes:
-	A formal process for approving changes to the project or its budget will be established and implemented.
<br>
<br>
g.	Reporting and communication:
-	Regular cost reports will be prepared and shared with stakeholders, including the project sponsor, project team, and management.
</p>

<p>By following these principles and practices, the project team will be able to effectively manage costs and ensure that the project stays on budget.</p>

==Measuring Project Cost==
<p>The Cost Management Plan for ADENICSY project will include a detailed approach for measuring project costs using Earned Value Management (EVM). This will involve capturing and reporting on various Earned Value metrics, such as:</p>

<p>
1. Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) - This measures the budgeted costs of the work that was planned to be completed at a specific point in time.
</p>

<p>
Example:<br>

To calculate the BCWS or Planned Value, we need to multiply the total labor cost of the TESTING WBS by its percentage of completion:<br>

BCWS = Total labor cost of TESTING WBS x Percentage of completion<br>
= (PHP 300,000) x 33.71%<br>
= PHP 101,130<br><br>

Therefore, the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) for the TESTING WBS is PHP 101,130.
<p>

<p>
2. Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) - This measures the budgeted costs of the work that has actually been completed at a specific point in time.
</p>

<p>
Example:<br>

To calculate the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV), we need to know the percentage of work completed for each task or WBS element. Assuming that the percentage of completion for each of the Testing<br>
Phase tasks are as follows:
<br>

<ul>
<li>Week 26: Testing Phase 1 - 100%</li>
<li>Week 27: Testing Phase 2 - 75%</li>
<li>Week 28: Testing Phase 3 - 50%</li>
<li>Week 29: Testing Phase 4 - 25%</li>
</ul>

Then, we can calculate the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) as follows:<br><br>
EV = BCWS x % of work completed<br>
EV = (₱300,000 x 33.71%) + (₱75,000 x 8.43% x 0.75) + (₱75,000 x 8.43% x 0.50) + (₱75,000 x 8.43% x 0.25)<br>
EV = ₱101,130 + ₱4,732.50 + ₱3,155 + ₱1,577.50<br>
EV = ₱110,595<br><br>

Therefore, the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) is ₱110,595.
<p>

<p>
3. Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) - This measures the actual costs incurred for the work that has been completed at a specific point in time.<br>
Example:<br>
Assuming that the Actual Cost for the TESTING WBS is PHP 120,000, then:<br>

AC = PHP 120,000<br><br>

Therefore, the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) is <br>
PHP 120,000.<br><br>

These metrics will be used to perform cost variance analysis (CV), schedule performance index (SPI), and cost performance index (CPI) to measure the project's cost performance over time.<br><br>
To assist in capturing these metrics, the project team will use project management software that is capable of tracking and reporting on EVM metrics. This software will also be used to forecast future project costs, and to review cost performance over time, across work packages or schedule activities.

<ol>
<li>Cost Variance (CV) measures the difference between the actual cost and the planned cost of the project. It is calculated by subtracting the actual cost from the planned cost. A negative CV indicates that the project is over budget, while a positive CV indicates that the project is under budget.<br>

Example:<br><br>

To compute the Cost Variance (CV), we need to subtract the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) from the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV). From the previous example, the BCWP or EV is ₱110,595, and the ACWP or AC is ₱120,000.<br><br>

CV = EV - AC<br>
CV = ₱110,595 - ₱120,000<br>
CV = -₱9,405<br><br>

Therefore, the Cost Variance (CV) for the Testing WBS is -₱9,405. A negative CV means that the project is over budget.<br>
</li>
<li>
Schedule Performance Index (SPI) measures the project's schedule performance by comparing the planned schedule to the actual schedule. This index is calculated as the ratio of the BCWP to the BCWS. It is calculated by dividing the earned value by the planned value. A value of 1 indicates that the project is on schedule, while a value less than 1 indicates that the project is behind schedule, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the project is ahead of schedule.<br><br>

Example:<br>

From the previous computations, we have:<br>

Earned Value (EV) = ₱110,595<br>
Planned Value (PV) = ₱101,130<br>
Plugging these values into the formula, we get:<br><br>

SPI = EV / PV<br>
SPI = ₱110,595 / ₱101,130<br>
SPI = 1.093<br><br>

Therefore, the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is 1.093. This indicates that the project is ahead of schedule, as the SPI is greater than 1.<br>
</li>
<li>
Cost Performance Index (CPI) measures the project's cost performance by comparing the actual cost to the planned cost. This index is calculated as the ratio of the BCWP to the ACWP. It is calculated by dividing the earned value by the actual cost. A value of 1 indicates that the project is on budget, while a value less than 1 indicates that the project is over budget, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the project is under budget.<br><br>

Example:<br>
To calculate the Cost Performance Index (CPI), we need to use the following formula:<br>

CPI = EV / AC<br>
where:<br>
EV = Earned Value (BCWP) <br>
AC = Actual Cost (ACWP)<br>

From the previous computations, we have:<br>
EV = ₱110,595<br>
AC = ₱120,000<br><br>

CPI = EV / AC<br>
CPI = ₱110,595 / ₱120,000<br>
CPI = 0.9216<br><br>

Therefore, the Cost Performance Index (CPI) is 0.9216. This means that for every one peso spent, the project has earned only 0.92 pesos of value. This indicates that the project is behind budget and may need to take corrective actions to bring the costs in line with the planned budget.<br><br>

In summary, the Cost Management Plan will ensure that the project costs are effectively managed and controlled throughout the project’s lifecycle by using Earned Value Management metrics, schedule performance index, and cost performance index. These metrics will help the team to identify the areas where the project is underperforming and take corrective actions to bring the project back on track.<br>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
==Reporting Format==
<p>
The ideal reporting format for the cost management plan of the Dispatch Directory system project would likely be a detailed spreadsheet or table. This format should include all relevant cost information such as project budget, actual costs incurred, projected costs, and any variances or discrepancies.<br>
Additionally, the format should be easily understandable and accessible to all stakeholders, including the project team, stakeholders, and management. A bar chart or Gantt chart can also be included to provide a visual representation of the cost information. The reporting format for the cost management plan of the Dispatch Directory system project would include the following elements:<br>
</p>


<p>
1.Executive Summary:<br>
A brief overview of the cost management plan, including the project's overall budget, any major cost variances or issues, and any actions taken to address them.<br>

2.Budget Overview:<br>
A detailed breakdown of the project's budget, including the total project cost, the cost of each phase or deliverable, and the costs associated with each project resource (e.g., labor, materials, equipment, etc.).<br>

3.Cost Variance Analysis:<br>
A detailed analysis of any variances between the project's actual costs and the budgeted costs. This should include a detailed explanation of the causes of the variances, the impact on the project, and any actions taken to address them.

4.Budget Forecast:<br>
A projection of the project's future costs, including any potential cost variances and their potential impact on the project. <br>

5.Cost Management Metrics:<br>
A set of key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide a snapshot of the project's cost performance, including cost variance, cost performance index (CPI), and schedule performance index (SPI).<br>

6.Approval and Sign-off:<br>
A section for the project manager and other key stakeholders to review, approve, and sign off on the cost management plan.<br>

7.Appendices:<br>
Any additional documentation or supporting materials, such as detailed cost breakdowns, invoices, or change request forms.<br><br>

It is important to note that this is a general outline, and the reporting format may vary depending on the specific needs of the project and organization. However, it should provide a comprehensive overview of the project's cost management and performance in order to make informed decisions.<br>
</p>

==Cost Variance Response Process==
<p>
The Cost Variance Response process for ADENICSY project will be as follows:<br>

1.Control Thresholds:<br>
-	The project will have several control thresholds set for cost variance.<br>
-	These thresholds will be set at 5%, 10%, and 15% of the total project budget.<br>
-	If the project triggers any of these thresholds, it will be considered a cost variance.<br><br>

2.	Identification of Variance:<br>
-	The Project Manager will be responsible for identifying any cost variances and reporting them to the Project Sponsor.<br>
-	The Project Manager will use the Earned Value Metrics and other cost management tools to identify and track any variances.<br><br>

3.	Analysis of Variance:<br>
-	The Project Manager will analyze the variance to determine the root cause of the problem and develop options for corrective action.<br>
-	The Project Manager will also consider the impact of the variance on the project schedule and scope.<br><br>

4.	Presentation of Options:<br>
-	The Project Manager will present the options for corrective action to the Project Sponsor.<br>
-	The options will be based on the root cause of the variance and the impact on the project schedule and scope.<br><br>

5.	Approval of Corrective Action:<br>
-	The Project Sponsor will review the options and approve an appropriate action to bring the project back on budget.<br>
-	This may include increasing the budget, reducing scope or quality, or implementing other corrective actions.<br><br>

6.	Implementation of Corrective Action:<br>
-	The Project Manager will implement the approved corrective action and monitor the results.<br>

</p>

==Cost Change Control Process==
<p>
The cost change control process will include the following steps:<br><br>

1.	Identification of the cost change:<br>
-	Any proposed changes to the project budget or costs must be identified and documented in a cost change request form.<br><br>
2.	Analysis of the cost change:<br>
-	The proposed change will be analyzed by the project team to determine the potential impact on the project schedule, resources, and overall budget.<br><br>
3.	Approval of the cost change:<br>
-	The cost change request will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor and other relevant stakeholders.<br><br>
4.	Implementation of the cost change:<br>
-	Once approved, the cost change will be implemented in accordance with the project schedule and budget.<br><br>
5.	Tracking and monitoring of the cost change:<br>
-	The project team will track and monitor the impact of the cost change on the project schedule and budget, and any necessary adjustments will be made to ensure the project stays on track.<br><br>
6.	Reporting on the cost change:<br>
-	The cost change will be reported in the monthly project status report, along with any relevant financial information and any corrective actions taken.<br><br>

The cost change control process will be implemented to ensure that any changes to the project budget or costs are identified, analyzed, and approved in a timely manner. This will help to minimize the impact of cost changes on the project schedule and budget and help to ensure that the project stays on track to meet its objectives.<br>

</p>

==Project Budget==
<p>
Budgeting is a crucial component of project management that involves planning, estimating, and controlling project costs. For the Dispatch Directory System project, a budget has been developed to ensure that project costs are identified, monitored, and controlled throughout the project's life cycle.<br>
The budget includes direct and indirect costs, and it is designed to provide the project team and stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the financial resources required to successfully complete the project. This budget will serve as a baseline for monitoring the project's financial performance and ensuring that it remains on track to meet its goals and objectives within the approved budget.<br><br><br>

=Time Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Schedule Management Plan is crucial because it provides direction and information in this area and specifies how the project's schedule will be handled throughout the entire project. After evaluating, managing, and prioritizing all time-related schedule alterations, the schedule management plan specifies strategies and tactics and distributes them.</p>

==Schedule Management Approach==
<p>The project team and the resources assigned to it will cautiously work on the initial schedule once it has been produced in order to prevent the project's schedule from being in the critical path. The proposed work package task, the length of the activities, and the project timeline require the approval of the project team and assets. Once this has been completed, the project adviser will check, approve, and baseline the schedule.</p>
<br>
<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">
     <tr>
        <td><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Milestone</b></p></td>

<br>
<p>When such changes are made, the plans and baselines will be updated. Furthermore, the same are shown as outputs. The scheduling approach, method of evaluation, tools, management, and control of the schedule will all be impacted by the development strategy.</p>
<br>
<p>The following are the roles and responsibilities involved in developing a schedule:</p>

           </ul>
        </td>
     </tr>
</table>

==Schedule Control==
<p>For the duration of the project, the schedule must be precisely and effectively managed. Meetings, schedules, project updates, and even changes to the project schedule go through the project manager, who is also responsible for managing them. The project manager will also be responsible for informing and keeping the project client informed of the project's status.</p>
<br>
<p>The project team, on the other hand, is required to attend meetings for any schedule updates provided and work on any timetable adjustments that would be made. The percentage of completion must be presented to the project team for discussion by project team members who also complete a task.</p>

==Schedule Changes and Thresholds==
<p>When the project team creates the schedule, the project sponsor must specify a deadline for the project to be finished or operational. This is essential because it enables the project sponsor to align the objectives and expectations of the project client with the project at hand. One of the factors that could affect the changes in schedule is poor schedule management, which requires an extension or change in the project plan. If there are any circumstances that might potentially affect the timetable and go beyond the limits specified by the project sponsor, the project manager should submit a schedule change request and it should be approved by the project sponsor before the schedule change is made.</p>
<br>
<p>If any of the following apply, a schedule change request must be submitted to the project stakeholder for approval, if not, then submission is made for approval to the project manager: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The suggested change is to limit the length of deliverables of a given Sprint Backlog during the project's development phase, to make it obvious that adding something to the duration does not indicate extending the work across the full duration.</li>
    <li>Changes to the scope statement must be taken into consideration in order to prevent conflicts during the project's documentation phase. The project team must compile every mistake in the document before expanding the work packages by 5% or more to reflect the changes in all the documentation.</li>
    <li>A different way to implement the changes is to either cut or extend the project's overall timetable by 10% or more.</li>
</ul>

==Scope Change==
<p>If a project problem arises that requires a substantial change in the project scope, it is best to propose a change. It is necessary to use prudence during the process of suggesting and evaluating the project's scope adjustment. Any project team member or project client may ask to change the project's scope. All change requests must be submitted in the form of a project change request document to the project advisor. Following that, the project manager will go over the requested change to the project's scope. The project adviser will either reject the request for change if it does not fit in with the project's goals or schedule, a meeting with the project client and project team to discuss it and determine its impact. Following initial approval from the project client and project adviser, the project manager will communicate the scope change to the entire project team. In result of that, the team members will amend any applicable paperwork, deliverables, and product backlogs. </p>


=Quality Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>Dental clinic systems are complex organizations that treat varieties of problems for their patients. With a quality system it would drastically increase their productivity and even give convenience of access for their staff and patients. This thesis was created for Apelo dental clinic as they were the chosen client for this research. This research and creation of this system would not only help the clinic but will make treatment fast and easy while also generating satisfaction for their customers.</p>

==Quality Objectives==
<br>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the system has complete functions that also show easier navigation and great responsiveness. </li>
<li>The criteria’s requested by the client to be met. </li>
<li>To achieve a quality standard not only for the client but also to the patients they serve. </li>
<li>Clarify the roles and responsibilities of each member. </li>
<li>Establish objectives that would manage and uphold the project quality across the course of the subject. </li>
</ul>
<br>
==Quality Management Plan==
<br>
<ul>
   <li><b>Project Completion - </b> when the project objectives have been achieved and proper backups have been created for potential risks regarding within the system.</li>
   <li><b>Acceptance criteria - </b> when the project has achieved standards regarding user-friendliness and operation of functions, buttons, and commands. </li>
   <li><b>Continuous integration – </b> for future updates and expanding of system operations, the developers would recommend a compatible and capable developer of handling the system.</li>
   <li><b>Test-driven development – </b> the system would be heavily tested to ensure its functions are working in their best condition and that the code would satisfy the quality of the system as its integration to live servers. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>This quality management plan provides a comprehensive framework for managing, maintaining, and improving project quality. This plan ensures that the project meets its objectives with regards to the clients’ requests, stakeholders, its users, and even the patients, providing a clear set of rules, guidelines, process, tools, and roles and responsibilities for using, creating, and improving the system itself and any issues that may arise. All stakeholders should be familiarized with the changes, the plan itself, and their role contribution in the project. </p>

==Quality Management Approach==
<p>ADENICSY will utilize an Agile and Scrum method and various testing processes to ensure that the project system delivers a high-quality product or even exceeds the expectations of all stakeholders’ expectations.

<p>The Agile and Scrum techniques will be employed to promote continuous inspection and modification throughout the project lifecycle for the Dispatch Directory System project, which will adopt a transparent and collaborative approach to quality control.  </p>
<p> To guarantee that the product fulfills the standards and criteria, quality control measures will  be  made  at  each  stage  of  the  development  process  and  documented  on  a  shared, viewable platform, such as a project management tool, as opposed to a static spreadsheet or table.  </p>
<p> The following details will be on the platform:  </p>
<ul>
   <li>Measurement Date</li>
   <li>Measurement type (e.g., automated testing, code review, peer review, user story acceptance) </li>
   <li>The measurement's findings (such as passed/failed, the number of flaws discovered, and the percentage of code coverage) </li>
   <li>Requirements and standards for comparison </li>
   <li>Member of the team in charge of measuring </li>
   <li>Team member responsible for assessing the measurement results</li>
   <li>Taking any required corrective actions</li>
   <li>The date that the remedial measures were finished  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Dashboards and other visual tools will be used to track the quality control measurements in real-time so that all team members can readily access and comprehend the data. The dashboards will draw attention to patterns and problem areas so that the team can act fast and make the necessary adjustments. The quality control metrics will be reviewed, and the method will be adjusted as necessary during routine team reviews such as sprint reviews and retrospectives. Together, the group  will  pinpoint  potential  improvement  areas  and  put  any  found  problems  into practice.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Dispatch Directory System project will use Agile and Scrum approaches to implement a collaborative and dynamic quality control strategy. To make sure the product satisfies the standards and needs, the team will regularly assess the product's quality and make the required improvements. On a common platform, all quality control measurements will be collected and tracked in real-time. The team will collaborate to address any problems and implement any necessary improvements. </p>
