=Company Profile=
<p>Apelo Dental Clinic (ADC) is located in Dr Arcadio Santos Ave, Parañaque City established in 2001. Their mission is to provide quality service with affordable price, so no one is deprived of good oral health care and their vision is to continuously upgrade to deliver highest dental care in safe environment for life-long. With their mission and vision, they were able to accumulate many patients that keeps coming back to the clinic for their service.
</p>
=Business Case=
==Executive Summary==
==Issue==
<p>At the Apelo Dental Clinic currently, traditional techniques are employed to conduct business operations, including the utilization of index cards for patient data, and writing numbers on paper to schedule appointments. Patients arrive at the clinic as early as 4 in the morning to obtain a queue number, which will give them a better chance of being seen earlier. However, the clinic only commences its operations at 9 in the morning. Since patient information and payment records are both kept on index cards, some records of other patients cannot be found. In each of the processes implemented in Apelo Dental Clinic, patients and clinic staff encounter difficulties or challenges. </p>
==Anticipated Outcomes==
<p>The project anticipated outcomes of an efficient web application namely Apelo Dental Clinic System (ADENICSY) by the end of June 2023. The implementation will take place within the company's intranet, utilizing the existing records. The proposed system should include 6 major functionalities for account management of patients and employees, queuing management, search function, dental records and payment records management, and dashboard. 

The execution of the proposed project will lead to an enhanced user experience at Apelo Dental Clinic by reducing waiting time and preventing the loss of patient data. The need to physically go to the clinic to obtain a queue number and inquire about the current serving number will be eliminated. The digitalization of patient data will enable the Dental Clinic to retrieve patient information quickly and prevent the excessive use of physical space. Additionally, the system will allow patients to access their payment records for services received and view their remaining balance.
</p>
==Recommendation==
<p>
As a solution to the issues that are listed, it is recommended to Apelo Dental Clinic combine all the functionalities. The project can alleviate the main pain points, which are the long waiting time for patients, and the loss of medical records of the patients. It is concluded in our interview with the patients of the clinic that having a poor queuing system is the main pain point of the clinic. 

As the team has plans on scaling in the future, it is also high time to transition from a traditional technique to a technology-ready clinic. Old data of the patients that are stored in the index cards will be transferred to each of their accounts, which means there will be fewer manual actions needed from the patient’s end.
</p>
==Justification==
<p>The Apelo Dental Clinic System is a much-needed solution for dental clinics facing challenges with manual processes, including long waiting times and the risk of losing patient records. Our system provides a digital platform to automate queueing and record-keeping, enabling clinics to increase efficiency, improve patient experience and reduce costs. With our system, patients can easily view their queueing status online, and clinics can maintain accurate and secure patient records without the risk of losing them.

The implementation of the Apelo Dental Clinic System is a worthwhile investment for dental clinics. The system will provide significant benefits, including reducing waiting times and errors, improving patient satisfaction and retention, and increasing the overall productivity of the clinic. By embracing digital technology, clinics can save time and costs, reduce manual errors, and improve the quality of patient care. Ultimately, the Apelo Dental Clinic System can lead to a more streamlined and efficient clinic operation, benefiting both patients and dental practitioners.

==Problem Definition==
<p> <b>Problem Statement</b></p>
<p>Apelo Dental Clinic is a company that provides a wide range of dental services to its customers. Usually, they focus on preserving good oral hygiene and avoiding or addressing dental problems. However, Apelo Dental Clinic System (ADENICSY) is a web application that supports day to day operation of Apelo Dental Clinic. 

The company employs manual procedures for its daily operations, which involve using paper-based systems for queuing management and index cards to keep track of patient data. This results in a delay of approximately 1 to 4 hours to obtain a number, and patient information retrieval is time-consuming and occupies significant space in the dental clinic. All the current manual procedures are vulnerable to human mistakes and data loss. Despite efforts to maintain a large amount of data, some are still lost, and patients experience excessive waiting times, making it difficult for the company to maintain all the data of their patients and accommodate all the patients in their dental clinic.</p>

<p><b>Organizational Impact</b></p>
<p>The implementation of Apelo Dental Clinic will have a significant impact on the company. By reducing long waiting times in queuing and improving the manual process of recording records, the clinic can redirect its savings toward other important initiatives. This will help drive the overall performance and efficiency of the company. <br>
<br>
In addition, the project aims to improve the current process by introducing agility into the system. By eliminating the need for patients to physically obtain numbers for queuing, the process becomes more efficient and saves time for both the patients and the clinic staff. Additionally, the project will address the challenge of storing patient information by reducing the amount of space required for physical storage. With these improvements, the clinic can focus on providing quality healthcare services and enhancing patient experiences. Overall, the project will revolutionize the healthcare sector by creating a seamless and hassle-free process for patients and healthcare providers alike.</p>

<p><b>Technology Migration</b></p>
<p>The system will be developed using HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL to create a web application, as they currently rely on manual processes that involve number cards and index cards. The data migration process will involve the dental clinic staff manually entering the information from the index cards. After the system is developed, it will be implemented through the company's VDI environment.</p>
