=Company Profile=
<p>The cafeteria is a facility of Asia Pacific College (APC) which is used by the students, staff, administrators, and faculty members of the school.
</p>
=Business Case=
==Executive Summary==
==Issue==
<p>The business problem that Rams E-Café is facing is the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their current ordering system. Currently, customers place their orders with the servers, who then manually key in the orders. This process is prone to errors, slow and inefficient, leading to long wait times for customers, and dissatisfied customers.</p>
==Anticipated Outcomes==
<p> 
With the implementation of an online ordering system, customers will have the convenience of placing their orders through a web application and picking them up at the food stall. This initiative will provide a better customer experience by reducing wait times and order errors. This will also help to reduce wastage and minimize stock-outs, ensuring that the café can operate efficiently and cost-effectively.
</p>
==Recommendation==
<p>
To address this issue, Rams E-Café is proposing the implementation of an online ordering system that allows customers to place their orders directly from their smartphones or computers. The proposed project aims to provide an online ordering system that is user-friendly, efficient, and cost-effective for both the customers and the business.
</p>
==Justification==
<p>
Rams E-Caf is recommended for implementation due to several reasons. Firstly, it will streamline the ordering process for customers, resulting in improved customer experience and satisfaction. The online platform will allow customers to place orders easily from the comfort of their homes or offices, reducing the wait time and eliminating the need for physical contact during the ordering process, which is especially important during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This will ultimately lead to increased customer loyalty and repeat business.

==Problem Definition==
<p> <b>Problem Statement</b></p>
<p>
Rams E-Caf, the business problem identified was the inefficient manual process of the cafeteria's daily operations. The cafeteria was using a traditional paper-based system for order-taking, and inventory management. This process was time-consuming, and error-prone, and, accident inventory counts, and difficulties in monitoring sales and revenue.
</p>
<p><b>Organizational Impact</b></p>
<p>
  •	To automate the cafeteria's daily operations and minimize the manual process by implementing a web-based cafeteria management system.<br>
•	To improve the accuracy and efficiency of the order-taking, billing, and inventory management process.<br>
•	To provide real-time sales and revenue monitoring capabilities to cafeteria management.<br>
•	To reduce operational costs.<br>
•	To enhance the customer experience by providing a user-friendly online ordering system.<br>
<br>
The proposed system would modify the current organizational processes by substituting the traditional paper-based system with an automated web-based system. This would require the installation of new hardware and software, including computers and servers, as well as the development of a custom software application for the cafeteria management system.
<br>
The new system would also create new roles, including system administrators, software developers, and technical support staff. Existing roles, such as cafeteria staff, would also change as they adapt to the new system and receive training on its use. Overall, the objective is to streamline and optimize the cafeteria's operations, resulting in improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.
</p>
<p><b>Technology Migration</b></p>
<p>
Rams E-Caf is a web-based cafeteria management system that will be accessed by a web browser and housed on a server. A team of IT professionals will most likely install and configure the system, working closely with cafeteria employees to ensure that the system is set up appropriately and fulfills their specific needs. The implementation process will almost certainly include numerous stages, such as system testing, user training, and data migration. 
</p>
==Project Overview==
<p><b>Project Description</b></p>
<p>
The Rams E-Caf project aims to provide a solution to the problem of long waiting times in the APC cafeteria. With the implementation of face-to-face and hybrid classes, students and staff will have less time to spare, making it crucial to manage their time effectively. Rams E-Caf is an online ordering platform exclusively for the APC community, which allows users to order their food ahead of time and pick it up at a designated time.<br>

<p><b>Goals and Objectives</b></p>
<p>
  The primary goal of the Rams E-Caf project is to improve the service time of food concessionaires, benefiting the APC community. The project's specific objectives include developing a web application with key features such as User Login, Menu for the day, Website Reports, Order and Payment System, Customer Feedback system, Dashboard for orders, and Edit Food Menu. The web application will be designed to enable food concessionaires to prepare food in advance, reduce wait times for customers, and improve overall customer experience.
</p>

<p>Low power and low interest: These stakeholders have little interest or influence in the project. They may require minimal communication and management.</p>
<p>To determine the level of impact stakeholders may have on the project, the team will use tools such as a stakeholder matrix or power/interest grid. These tools will help to identify which stakeholders may require more attention and resources to manage. The stakeholder analysis will also consider the potential risks and benefits associated with each stakeholder group. This will help the team to anticipate any conflicts or competing objectives among stakeholders and develop appropriate strategies to manage them.</p>
<p>Overall, the stakeholder analysis will enable the team to better understand the needs and expectations of each stakeholder group and develop an effective stakeholder management plan that addresses their concerns and supports the successful delivery of the project.</p>


=Scope Management Plan= 
==Introduction==
<p> The purpose of this Project Scope Management Plan is to define the scope management process for the Rams E-Caf project. The plan identifies the roles and responsibilities for managing the project scope, as well as the processes for collecting requirements, defining scope, creating a work breakdown structure, verifying scope, and controlling scope.
</p> 

<ol>
  <li><b>Collect Requirements</b> - The Rams E-Caf project team will identify and document the requirements necessary to meet all project objectives. The project charter and stakeholder register will be used to identify requirements, and the team will collectively discuss the details associated with meeting each requirement. Interviews and follow-on discussions will be conducted to clarify the requirements, and they will be documented in sufficient detail to measure them once the project begins the execution phase.</li>
  <li><b>Define Scope</b> -	The Rams E-Caf project team will develop a detailed project/product description that includes deliverables, assumptions, and constraints. This step will establish the framework within which project work must be performed and will be critical to project success.</li>
  <li><b>Create WBS</b> -	The project team will break down project deliverables into progressively smaller and more manageable components, which at the lowest level are called work packages. This hierarchical structure will allow for more simplicity in scheduling, costing, monitoring, and controlling the project.</li>
  <li><b>Verify Scope</b> - The project team will receive formalized acceptance of all deliverables with the sponsor and/or customer in the verify scope process. </li>
  <li><b>Control Scope</b> - The project team will monitor and control the project/product scope, as well as manage any changes in the scope baseline. Changes may be necessary to the project scope but must be controlled and integrated to prevent scope creep.</li>
</ol>

==Scope Management Approach==
<p>
  Authority and responsibility for the scope management will be helped by the project manager, Corneliani Jon Melo, who will work and communicate closely with the project sponsor, Ms. Bernadette Sison, and the stakeholders such as the food concessionaires.

  The scope of the project will be defined in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary and in the Statement of Work (SOW). These documents outline the project deliverables, tasks, and requirements which will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor and other stakeholders before any work in the development side begins.
  
  The scope of the project will be measured and verified with quality checklists and regular team meetings with the project sponsor. Any deviation from the scope will be addressed during the meeting and through the scope change process.
  
  The scope change process for the Rams E-Caf project will include the submission of a scope change request by the project manager with the final approval being granted by the project sponsor. Every detail included in the scope change request should be reviewed and evaluated to ensure that they align with the project goals and objectives but at the same time, does not negatively impact the project schedule and/or budget.
  
  The final project deliverables will be accepted and approved by the project sposor and the key stakeholders. The project manager on the other hand will be responsible for ensuring that all project requirements have been met. The project will be deemed successful once all of the deliverables have been accepted and any issues have been resolved.
  
</p>

==Role and Responsibilities==
<p>The content above outlines the roles and responsibilities of the key individuals involved in the Rams E-Caf project. Each role has specific responsibilities and is essential to the successful completion of the project. Understanding the roles and responsibilities of each team member is crucial to ensure effective communication and collaboration throughout the project's life cycle. By defining the roles and responsibilities, the project manager can set expectations, delegate tasks, and manage resources efficiently.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Project Manager:</b> The project manager is responsible for leading and managing the project team to achieve the project objectives within the constraints of time, budget, and scope.</li>
  <li><b>Developer/IT Head</b> The responsibility of a developer is to write, test, and maintain code that meets the project's requirements and is of high quality.</li>
  <li><b>UI/UX Designer</b> Responsible for creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces for digital products that meet user needs and business objectives.</li>
  <li><b>Documentation</b> The responsibility of a documentation specialist is to ensure that all project documentation is complete, accurate, and up to date.</li>
  <li><b>Stakeholders</b> Responsible for providing input, feedback, and making critical decisions related to the project to ensure its success.</li>
</ol>

==Scope Definition==
<p>
  The scope definition for the Rams E-Caf project was developed after the requirements were identified and defined during the requirements definition process. Three documents were created during this process, namely Project Charter, Business Case, and a Stakeholder Management Plan. These documents were used as references when defining the project's scope.

  The scope definition process involved developing a detailed description of the project and its deliverables. The Rams E-Caf project aims to create a fully functional e-commerce website for Rams Cafe that will allow customers to purchase food and beverage items online. The deliverables of the project include a functional website, a payment gateway for online transactions, and a user-friendly interface.
  
  To define the project's scope, various tools and techniques were used, such as expert judgment and product analysis. Expert judgment was used to gather inputs from industry experts and stakeholders on the project's requirements and deliverables. Product analysis was done to understand the market trends and competition to ensure that the project meets the customers' demands.
  
</p>

==Project Scope Statement==
<p>
  The project's goal is to address the issues of long wait times, inefficient use of manpower, and the implementation of social distancing guidelines by the IATF in the APC cafeteria with the development of an alternative online ordering system. The project will deliver a functional web application that meets the requirements of the stakeholders and improves the overall cafeteria experience for the APC community which consists of students, staff, and faculty members. The successful completion of the project will be measured by user satisfaction, decreased wait times, increased efficiency for the cafeteria's food concessionaires, and adherence to social distancing guidelines, as well as avoid the long queues with also achieving to process food with a timely manner.
 
  The users will only focus on the APC community and will not include non-APC community and non-APC concessionaires. The project will not include creating a native mobile application hence its infrastructure will be web-based and will be available through most browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Firefox. This will only be accessible by having an internet connection hence the project will only focus on this and will exclude problems of having no internet connection. Additionally, the focus solution is to digitalize the ordering system of APC cafeteria and will not interfere changing the lunch time or break time of the APC community, as well as all other solutions.
  
  Furthermore, the project will be supported by the APC by providing monitors or tablets depending on the chosen devices by the concessionaires thus there is no technology constraint. However, the project is subject to budget constraints, as it depends on approval from the project sponsor. Time is also a constraint, as the project must be completed by the end of the term and deliverables must be completed on schedule. The project must deliver a fully functional web application that meets the requirements of the stakeholders and is accepted by them as complete within the available resources and timeline.
  
  The successful completion of the project is based on shared assumptions between the project team and stakeholders. It is assumed that both parties understand the requirements and objectives of the project, and the project team has the technical capability and access to resources to develop and implement the online web application and it is assumed that both parties have agreed on the scope of the project. Moreover, the project team and stakeholders are committed to complying with all relevant laws, rules and regulations, guidelines, including those related to data privacy and security. Consequently, the importance of social distancing and other safety measures to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 is understood, and the implementation of the web application is assumed to aid these measures.

==Work Breakdown Structure==
<p>
  Scope management is a critical aspect of project management that involves defining, documenting, and controlling the project's boundaries. One of the essential tools for effective scope management is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), which is used to break down the project scope into smaller, manageable components. The WBS is then used to create the WBS Dictionary, which provides detailed information on the work packages, activities, and tasks required to complete each component. In this section, we will discuss how the project scope for Rams E-Caf will be subdivided into smaller deliverables in the WBS and WBS Dictionary and how these components will be managed during the project's life cycle.

<p>By following this scope control plan, the project team can ensure that the project remains within the defined boundaries and is completed within the set timeframe and budget.</p>

=Cost Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Cost Management Plan for Apelo Dental Clinic System (ADENICSY) project is designed to ensure that all costs associated with the project are effectively managed throughout its lifecycle. The plan outlines the format and standards by which the project costs will be measured, reported, and controlled.

<br><br>Cost management responsibilities:

<ul>
  <li>The Project Manager will be responsible for overall cost management of the project and will be the primary point of contact for all cost-related issues.</li>
  <li>The Finance Team will be responsible for monitoring project costs and ensuring that they are within the approved budget.</li>
</ul>

Cost change approval:
<ul>
  <li>All cost changes must be approved by the Project Manager before they are implemented.</li>
  <li>If the cost change exceeds 10% of the total project budget, it must be approved by the Project Sponsor before it can be implemented.</li>
</ul>

Cost measurement and reporting:
<ul>
  <li>Costs will be measured and reported on a monthly basis, using a cost performance index (CPI) and a schedule performance index (SPI).</li>
  <li>Reports will be presented to the Project Sponsor on a monthly basis.</li>
</ul>

Budget format and standards:
<ul>
  <li>The budget will be presented in a clear and concise format, using a spreadsheet format such as Excel.</li>
  <li>The budget will be broken down into individual line items, with detailed cost estimates for each item.</li>
  <li>The budget will be updated on a monthly basis, with any changes clearly highlighted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the Cost Management Plan for ADENICSY project is designed to ensure that all costs associated with the project are effectively managed and controlled, so that the project can be completed within the approved budget. This will help ensure that the project is completed successfully and on time.

==Cost Management Approach==
<p>The cost management approach for the dispatch directory system project will be based on the following principles:
</p>
<br>
<p>
a.	Clear definition of costs:
-	The project team will work closely with stakeholders to clearly define and document the costs associated with the project, including labor, materials, equipment, and other expenses.
<br>
<br>
b.	Budget development and tracking:
-	A detailed project budget will be developed and regularly updated throughout the project, with costs tracked and reported in real time.
<br>
<br>
c.	Cost estimates:
-	The project team will use a variety of cost estimation techniques to ensure that the project budget is accurate and realistic.
<br>
<br>
d.	Cost variance analysis:
-	The project team will closely monitor costs throughout the project and perform variance analysis to identify and address any cost overruns or savings.
<br>
<br>
e.	Cost management roles and responsibilities:
-	Clear roles and responsibilities for cost management will be defined and communicated to all project team members.
<br>
<br>
f.	Approval process for changes:
-	A formal process for approving changes to the project or its budget will be established and implemented.
<br>
<br>
g.	Reporting and communication:
-	Regular cost reports will be prepared and shared with stakeholders, including the project sponsor, project team, and management.
</p>

<p>By following these principles and practices, the project team will be able to effectively manage costs and ensure that the project stays on budget.</p>

==Measuring Project Cost==
<p>The Cost Management Plan for ADENICSY project will include a detailed approach for measuring project costs using Earned Value Management (EVM). This will involve capturing and reporting on various Earned Value metrics, such as:</p>

<p>
1. Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) - This measures the budgeted costs of the work that was planned to be completed at a specific point in time.
</p>

<p>
Example:<br>

To calculate the BCWS or Planned Value, we need to multiply the total labor cost of the TESTING WBS by its percentage of completion:<br>

BCWS = Total labor cost of TESTING WBS x Percentage of completion<br>
= (PHP 300,000) x 33.71%<br>
= PHP 101,130<br><br>

Therefore, the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV) for the TESTING WBS is PHP 101,130.
<p>

<p>
2. Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) - This measures the budgeted costs of the work that has actually been completed at a specific point in time.
</p>

<p>
Example:<br>

To calculate the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV), we need to know the percentage of work completed for each task or WBS element. Assuming that the percentage of completion for each of the Testing<br>
Phase tasks are as follows:
<br>

<ul>
<li>Week 26: Testing Phase 1 - 100%</li>
<li>Week 27: Testing Phase 2 - 75%</li>
<li>Week 28: Testing Phase 3 - 50%</li>
<li>Week 29: Testing Phase 4 - 25%</li>
</ul>

Then, we can calculate the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) as follows:<br><br>
EV = BCWS x % of work completed<br>
EV = (₱300,000 x 33.71%) + (₱75,000 x 8.43% x 0.75) + (₱75,000 x 8.43% x 0.50) + (₱75,000 x 8.43% x 0.25)<br>
EV = ₱101,130 + ₱4,732.50 + ₱3,155 + ₱1,577.50<br>
EV = ₱110,595<br><br>

Therefore, the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) is ₱110,595.
<p>

<p>
3. Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) - This measures the actual costs incurred for the work that has been completed at a specific point in time.<br>
Example:<br>
Assuming that the Actual Cost for the TESTING WBS is PHP 120,000, then:<br>

AC = PHP 120,000<br><br>

Therefore, the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) is <br>
PHP 120,000.<br><br>

These metrics will be used to perform cost variance analysis (CV), schedule performance index (SPI), and cost performance index (CPI) to measure the project's cost performance over time.<br><br>
To assist in capturing these metrics, the project team will use project management software that is capable of tracking and reporting on EVM metrics. This software will also be used to forecast future project costs, and to review cost performance over time, across work packages or schedule activities.

<ol>
<li>Cost Variance (CV) measures the difference between the actual cost and the planned cost of the project. It is calculated by subtracting the actual cost from the planned cost. A negative CV indicates that the project is over budget, while a positive CV indicates that the project is under budget.<br>

Example:<br><br>

To compute the Cost Variance (CV), we need to subtract the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC) from the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV). From the previous example, the BCWP or EV is ₱110,595, and the ACWP or AC is ₱120,000.<br><br>

CV = EV - AC<br>
CV = ₱110,595 - ₱120,000<br>
CV = -₱9,405<br><br>

Therefore, the Cost Variance (CV) for the Testing WBS is -₱9,405. A negative CV means that the project is over budget.<br>
</li>
<li>
Schedule Performance Index (SPI) measures the project's schedule performance by comparing the planned schedule to the actual schedule. This index is calculated as the ratio of the BCWP to the BCWS. It is calculated by dividing the earned value by the planned value. A value of 1 indicates that the project is on schedule, while a value less than 1 indicates that the project is behind schedule, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the project is ahead of schedule.<br><br>

Example:<br>

From the previous computations, we have:<br>

Earned Value (EV) = ₱110,595<br>
Planned Value (PV) = ₱101,130<br>
Plugging these values into the formula, we get:<br><br>

SPI = EV / PV<br>
SPI = ₱110,595 / ₱101,130<br>
SPI = 1.093<br><br>

Therefore, the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is 1.093. This indicates that the project is ahead of schedule, as the SPI is greater than 1.<br>
</li>
<li>
Cost Performance Index (CPI) measures the project's cost performance by comparing the actual cost to the planned cost. This index is calculated as the ratio of the BCWP to the ACWP. It is calculated by dividing the earned value by the actual cost. A value of 1 indicates that the project is on budget, while a value less than 1 indicates that the project is over budget, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the project is under budget.<br><br>

Example:<br>
To calculate the Cost Performance Index (CPI), we need to use the following formula:<br>

CPI = EV / AC<br>
where:<br>
EV = Earned Value (BCWP) <br>
AC = Actual Cost (ACWP)<br>

From the previous computations, we have:<br>
EV = ₱110,595<br>
AC = ₱120,000<br><br>

CPI = EV / AC<br>
CPI = ₱110,595 / ₱120,000<br>
CPI = 0.9216<br><br>

Therefore, the Cost Performance Index (CPI) is 0.9216. This means that for every one peso spent, the project has earned only 0.92 pesos of value. This indicates that the project is behind budget and may need to take corrective actions to bring the costs in line with the planned budget.<br><br>

In summary, the Cost Management Plan will ensure that the project costs are effectively managed and controlled throughout the project’s lifecycle by using Earned Value Management metrics, schedule performance index, and cost performance index. These metrics will help the team to identify the areas where the project is underperforming and take corrective actions to bring the project back on track.<br>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
==Reporting Format==
<p>
The ideal reporting format for the cost management plan of the Dispatch Directory system project would likely be a detailed spreadsheet or table. This format should include all relevant cost information such as project budget, actual costs incurred, projected costs, and any variances or discrepancies.<br>
Additionally, the format should be easily understandable and accessible to all stakeholders, including the project team, stakeholders, and management. A bar chart or Gantt chart can also be included to provide a visual representation of the cost information. The reporting format for the cost management plan of the Dispatch Directory system project would include the following elements:<br>
</p>


<p>
1.Executive Summary:<br>
A brief overview of the cost management plan, including the project's overall budget, any major cost variances or issues, and any actions taken to address them.<br>

2.Budget Overview:<br>
A detailed breakdown of the project's budget, including the total project cost, the cost of each phase or deliverable, and the costs associated with each project resource (e.g., labor, materials, equipment, etc.).<br>

3.Cost Variance Analysis:<br>
A detailed analysis of any variances between the project's actual costs and the budgeted costs. This should include a detailed explanation of the causes of the variances, the impact on the project, and any actions taken to address them.

4.Budget Forecast:<br>
A projection of the project's future costs, including any potential cost variances and their potential impact on the project. <br>

5.Cost Management Metrics:<br>
A set of key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide a snapshot of the project's cost performance, including cost variance, cost performance index (CPI), and schedule performance index (SPI).<br>

6.Approval and Sign-off:<br>
A section for the project manager and other key stakeholders to review, approve, and sign off on the cost management plan.<br>

7.Appendices:<br>
Any additional documentation or supporting materials, such as detailed cost breakdowns, invoices, or change request forms.<br><br>

It is important to note that this is a general outline, and the reporting format may vary depending on the specific needs of the project and organization. However, it should provide a comprehensive overview of the project's cost management and performance in order to make informed decisions.<br>
</p>

==Cost Variance Response Process==
<p>
The Cost Variance Response process for ADENICSY project will be as follows:<br>

1.Control Thresholds:<br>
-	The project will have several control thresholds set for cost variance.<br>
-	These thresholds will be set at 5%, 10%, and 15% of the total project budget.<br>
-	If the project triggers any of these thresholds, it will be considered a cost variance.<br><br>

2.	Identification of Variance:<br>
-	The Project Manager will be responsible for identifying any cost variances and reporting them to the Project Sponsor.<br>
-	The Project Manager will use the Earned Value Metrics and other cost management tools to identify and track any variances.<br><br>

3.	Analysis of Variance:<br>
-	The Project Manager will analyze the variance to determine the root cause of the problem and develop options for corrective action.<br>
-	The Project Manager will also consider the impact of the variance on the project schedule and scope.<br><br>

4.	Presentation of Options:<br>
-	The Project Manager will present the options for corrective action to the Project Sponsor.<br>
-	The options will be based on the root cause of the variance and the impact on the project schedule and scope.<br><br>

5.	Approval of Corrective Action:<br>
-	The Project Sponsor will review the options and approve an appropriate action to bring the project back on budget.<br>
-	This may include increasing the budget, reducing scope or quality, or implementing other corrective actions.<br><br>

6.	Implementation of Corrective Action:<br>
-	The Project Manager will implement the approved corrective action and monitor the results.<br>
-	The Project Manager will also update the project schedule and budget accordingly.<br><br>

7.	Reporting:<br>
-	The Project Manager will report the cost variance, corrective action taken, and the results of the corrective action in the Monthly Project Status Report.<br>
-	The Project Manager will also provide updates on the project budget and schedule.<br><br>

The Cost Variance Response process will be an ongoing process throughout the project lifecycle. The Project Manager will be responsible for monitoring and controlling the project costs, and the Project Sponsor will be responsible for approving any corrective actions as needed. <br>
</p>

==Cost Change Control Process==
<p>
The cost change control process will include the following steps:<br><br>

1.	Identification of the cost change:<br>
-	Any proposed changes to the project budget or costs must be identified and documented in a cost change request form.<br><br>
2.	Analysis of the cost change:<br>
-	The proposed change will be analyzed by the project team to determine the potential impact on the project schedule, resources, and overall budget.<br><br>
3.	Approval of the cost change:<br>
-	The cost change request will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor and other relevant stakeholders.<br><br>
4.	Implementation of the cost change:<br>
-	Once approved, the cost change will be implemented in accordance with the project schedule and budget.<br><br>
5.	Tracking and monitoring of the cost change:<br>
-	The project team will track and monitor the impact of the cost change on the project schedule and budget, and any necessary adjustments will be made to ensure the project stays on track.<br><br>
6.	Reporting on the cost change:<br>
-	The cost change will be reported in the monthly project status report, along with any relevant financial information and any corrective actions taken.<br><br>

The cost change control process will be implemented to ensure that any changes to the project budget or costs are identified, analyzed, and approved in a timely manner. This will help to minimize the impact of cost changes on the project schedule and budget and help to ensure that the project stays on track to meet its objectives.<br>

</p>

==Project Budget==
<p>
Budgeting is a crucial component of project management that involves planning, estimating, and controlling project costs. For the Dispatch Directory System project, a budget has been developed to ensure that project costs are identified, monitored, and controlled throughout the project's life cycle.<br>
The budget includes direct and indirect costs, and it is designed to provide the project team and stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the financial resources required to successfully complete the project. This budget will serve as a baseline for monitoring the project's financial performance and ensuring that it remains on track to meet its goals and objectives within the approved budget.<br><br><br>


<bold>Approved Budget: PHP 900,000.00</bold>

=Time Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Schedule Management Plan is crucial because it provides direction and information in this area and specifies how the project's schedule will be handled throughout the entire project. After evaluating, managing, and prioritizing all time-related schedule alterations, the schedule management plan specifies strategies and tactics and distributes them.</p>

==Schedule Management Approach==
<p>The project team and the resources assigned to it will cautiously work on the initial schedule once it has been produced in order to prevent the project's schedule from being in the critical path. The proposed work package task, the length of the activities, and the project timeline require the approval of the project team and assets. Once this has been completed, the project adviser will check, approve, and baseline the schedule.</p>
<br>
<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">

<br>
<p>When such changes are made, the plans and baselines will be updated. Furthermore, the same are shown as outputs. The scheduling approach, method of evaluation, tools, management, and control of the schedule will all be impacted by the development strategy.</p>

           </ul>
        </td>
     </tr>
</table>

==Schedule Control==
<p>For the duration of the project, the schedule must be precisely and effectively managed. Meetings, schedules, project updates, and even changes to the project schedule go through the project manager, who is also responsible for managing them. The project manager will also be responsible for informing and keeping the project client informed of the project's status.</p>
<br>
<p>The project team, on the other hand, is required to attend meetings for any schedule updates provided and work on any timetable adjustments that would be made. The percentage of completion must be presented to the project team for discussion by project team members who also complete a task.</p>

==Schedule Changes and Thresholds==
<p>When the project team creates the schedule, the project sponsor must specify a deadline for the project to be finished or operational. This is essential because it enables the project sponsor to align the objectives and expectations of the project client with the project at hand. One of the factors that could affect the changes in schedule is poor schedule management, which requires an extension or change in the project plan. If there are any circumstances that might potentially affect the timetable and go beyond the limits specified by the project sponsor, the project manager should submit a schedule change request and it should be approved by the project sponsor before the schedule change is made.</p>
<br>
<p>If any of the following apply, a schedule change request must be submitted to the project stakeholder for approval, if not, then submission is made for approval to the project manager: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The suggested change is to limit the length of deliverables of a given Sprint Backlog during the project's development phase, to make it obvious that adding something to the duration does not indicate extending the work across the full duration.</li>
    <li>Changes to the scope statement must be taken into consideration in order to prevent conflicts during the project's documentation phase. The project team must compile every mistake in the document before expanding the work packages by 5% or more to reflect the changes in all the documentation.</li>
    <li>A different way to implement the changes is to either cut or extend the project's overall timetable by 10% or more.</li>
</ul>

==Scope Change==
<p>If a project problem arises that requires a substantial change in the project scope, it is best to propose a change. It is necessary to use prudence during the process of suggesting and evaluating the project's scope adjustment. Any project team member or project client may ask to change the project's scope. All change requests must be submitted in the form of a project change request document to the project advisor. Following that, the project manager will go over the requested change to the project's scope. The project adviser will either reject the request for change if it does not fit in with the project's goals or schedule, a meeting with the project client and project team to discuss it and determine its impact. Following initial approval from the project client and project adviser, the project manager will communicate the scope change to the entire project team. In result of that, the team members will amend any applicable paperwork, deliverables, and product backlogs. </p>

=Work Breakdown Structure=

==Introduction==
<p>The Apelo Dental Clinic System has the main goal to lessen the waiting time of the patients through queueing management, digitalization of patient’s dental records, and automating several manual processes to improve the clinic’s performance. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for Apelo Dental Clinic System outlines the various work packages that must be accomplished to deliver a functional and user-friendly e-commerce web application. The WBS presents the project scope and helps in defining the deliverables that must be accomplished to meet the project objectives. This document will provide an overview of the WBS layout for Apelo Dental Clinic System.</p>
<br>
<p>The WBS is organized into five major phases, which include project planning, analysis and design, development, documentation, and development II. Each phase is further broken down into several sub-phases or work packages, which are numbered for easy reference. The WBS has been designed to accommodate the key stakeholders, including the project owner, Doctor Denroe Apelo. Doctor Apelo will have the opportunity to review the WBS to ensure that the project goals are being met, and any adjustments can be made before the project progresses too far.</p>
<br>
<p>Overall, the WBS for Apelo Dental Clinic System provides a comprehensive view of the tasks needed to deliver a fully-functional e-commerce web application. It is an essential tool that helps the project team in tracking and monitoring the progress of the project, ensuring that it is delivered on time and to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.</p>
<br>

==Outline View==
<p>The outline view for the work breakdown structure (WBS) of Apelo Dental Clinic System provides a straightforward and clear layout that is easy to understand. This layout is particularly useful during the development phase of the project as it enables the project team to make changes quickly and efficiently. The outline view displays the hierarchical structure of the WBS, which allows the project team to easily see the various levels of the project and how they relate to one another. With this view, the team can easily identify the major deliverables of the project and the sub-deliverables that contribute to the completion of each major deliverable. This helps ensure that the project team stays on track and is able to complete the project within the established timeline.</p>
