In implementing the Tracking Activity Project Management, our strategic approach is grounded in a comprehensive evaluation of the project's requisites and limitations. Our team will adhere to a meticulously planned and flexible product development methodology, specifically designed to guarantee the punctual delivery of an exceptional product that aligns with the client's envisioned outcomes.

<span id="product-development-methodology"></span>
== 6.1. Product Development Methodology ==

Our product management approach combines elements of both agile and traditional project management frameworks to optimize the development process. By leveraging agile methods like Scrum, we can achieve rapid iterations and incorporate continuous feedback from stakeholders.

Concurrently, we will utilize traditional project management methods such as Waterfall to ensure timely delivery and adherence to budgetary constraints.

The methodology encompasses the following sequential steps:

# Project Initiation: This phase involves identifying the project goals, stakeholders, and overall scope. We establish clear objectives and define the project's initial requirements and constraints.
# Planning: In this stage, we create a comprehensive project plan that outlines tasks, timelines, resource allocation, and communication strategies. The plan serves as a roadmap for the project's execution and guides decision- making throughout.
# Execution: During the execution phase, we carry out the planned activities, develop the product, and implement the necessary processes. Agile practices, like Scrum, enable iterative development, regular team collaboration, and frequent feedback from stakeholders.
# Monitoring and Controlling: Throughout the project, we continually monitor progress, track key performance indicators, and assess adherence to the project plan. By closely managing resources, risks, and dependencies, we can proactively address any issues or deviations.
# Closure: Once the product is developed and meets the specified criteria, we conclude the project. This involves finalizing documentation, conducting final reviews, obtaining client approval, and transitioning the product to the appropriate stakeholders or operational teams.

Throughout the product development life cycle, we emphasize continuous communication with the client to ensure their needs are met and to provide regular updates on project progress. Additionally, we prioritize user experience and design, aiming to create an intuitive and user-friendly product that aligns with customer expectations.

By combining agile and traditional project management approaches, we can leverage the benefits of iterative development, stakeholder collaboration, and efficient project control. This hybrid methodology allows us to deliver high- quality products within specified timelines and budgetary constraints.

<span id="technical-architecture"></span>
== 6.2. Technical Architecture ==

The Tracking Activity Project Management system will be developed using the Laravel Framework, which offers an expressive and elegant syntax and provides various features necessary for building modern web applications. This includes routing, validation, caching, queues, and file storage capabilities.

For the user interface, modern front-end technologies such as Bootstrap will be utilized. This will ensure a responsive and intuitive experience for users. In the back end, a combination of Node.js and PHP syntax will be employed to create a robust and reliable system.

The technical architecture of the project management system follows a client-server model, where the client is a web browser, and the server is the application server. The server-side will be developed and hosted using the XAMPP web server. The application will adhere to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture provided by the Laravel Framework.

The Model component represents the data and business logic of the application. In Laravel, models are PHP classes that interact with the database, defining table structures and providing methods for data querying and manipulation. The View component is responsible for presenting data to users and represents the user interface. Laravel utilizes the Blade templating engine for creating clean and readable templates with dynamic content. The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user requests, interacts with the Model to retrieve or update data, and passes the data to the View for display. Laravel's Controllers are PHP classes that manage the logic of different HTTP requests.

To ensure application security, the technical architecture incorporates Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection. Laravel automatically generates and verifies CSRF tokens for HTML forms submitted to the application. This safeguards against CSRF attacks, where attackers trick users into submitting malicious requests on their behalf.

Scalability is a key consideration in technical architecture. Load balancers, clustering, and other scalability techniques will be implemented to accommodate future growth and expansion.

In summary, the technical architecture of the Tracking Activity Project Management system focuses on robustness, security, and scalability. It leverages the Laravel Framework, modern front-end technologies, and a client-server model to deliver a reliable and efficient application.

== 7.1 Stakeholders Strategy Management Plan ==

<span id="introduction"></span>
=== 7.1.1 Introduction ===

A stakeholder management strategy serves as a cornerstone for project success. Within the context of the current project charter, which empowers the Project Development Office (PDO) of Asia Pacific College to establish a collaborative platform for monitoring, tracking, and generating reports on projects assigned to student groups in collaboration with industry partners, an encompassing stakeholder management strategy is crucial. The PDO endeavors to closely collaborate with project proponents to formulate a comprehensive project plan that encompasses various essential components, including provisions for effective stakeholder management. The overarching objective is to ensure that all stakeholders are not only adequately identified but also actively engaged and proficiently managed throughout the project's entire lifecycle.

<span id="identify-stakeholders"></span>
=== Identify Stakeholders ===

The stakeholders for the project include the following groups:

* Project Development Office (PDO) staff
* Proponents of the project
* Student groups assigned to the project.
* Industry partners
* Project sponsors
* Faculty members
* End-users of the project outcomes

To identify stakeholders, the project team will employ a methodology that involves analyzing the project's goals, objectives, and requirements, and then mapping these to potential stakeholders who may be impacted by the project. The project team will also consult with key stakeholders to identify additional stakeholders and obtain feedback on stakeholder identification. All stakeholders will be defined based on their level of interest, influence, and involvement in the project. Great care and effort will be dedicated to ensuring that all stakeholders are identified and engaged throughout the project's lifecycle.

<span id="key-stakeholders"></span>
=== Key Stakeholders ===

These stakeholders have been identified as key stakeholders because they potentially have the most influence over the project or may be most affected by the project. Additionally, they may be stakeholders who are resistant to the change represented by the project. Due to their significance, these key stakeholders may require more communication and management throughout the project's lifecycle. It is important to identify them to seek their feedback on their desired level of participation and communication to ensure that their concerns are addressed, and their needs are met. This helps to increase stakeholder engagement, improve project outcomes, and increase the likelihood of success.

=== 7.2.7 Scope Verification ===

To ensure that the deliverables of the Tracking Activity Project Management System project align with the original project scope, the project team will employ various methods for scope verification. These methods will involve:

* Quality checklists: A list of specific requirements for each deliverable to be accepted. The project team will use these checklists to ensure that all deliverables meet the necessary criteria before proceeding.
* Work performance measurements: The project team will monitor and measure the progress of each deliverable during development. This will enable them to identify and resolve any potential issues or deviations from the original scope in a timely manner.
* Scope baseline: The project team will maintain a scope baseline, which is a snapshot of the original project scope. Any modifications to the scope must be documented and approved before they can be implemented. The scope baseline will be utilized to confirm that the final deliverables align with the original scope.
* Formal acceptance: The project sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders will formally accept each deliverable upon completion. This ensures that the project team meets the expectations of all relevant parties â€” allowing for any necessary feedback or changes to be made promptly.

<span id="scope-control"></span>
=== 7.2.8 Scope Control ===

The scope control process for the Tracking Activity Project Management System project will involve regular reviews of the project's deliverables and progress to ensure that they align with the original project scope as defined in the Project Scope Statement. Any deviations from the scope will be evaluated and, if necessary, changes to the scope will be documented and approved through the established scope change process. The Project Manager will be responsible for monitoring and controlling the project's scope, with assistance from the project team and stakeholders. Periodic reviews of the project's scope will be conducted to ensure that the project remains on track and within the defined boundaries. The project manager will also be responsible for ensuring that any scope changes are properly documented and that all impacted parties are notified of any changes.

The scope control process for the Tracking Activity Project Management System project will involve the following steps for making changes to the scope baseline:

# A scope change request will be initiated by any stakeholder or team member who identifies a need for a change to the scope.
# The scope change request will be reviewed by the Project manager and the Project Sponsor to assess the impact of the change on the project schedule, budget, and resources.
# If the change is deemed low impact, the Project Manager can approve or deny the request. If the change is deemed high impact, the Project manager can approve or deny the request. Any low impact change request approved or denied by the Project Manager can be reviewed and overruled by the Project Sponsor.
# If the request is approved, the Project Manager will create an action plan to proceed with the change, update the scope baseline, and notify all relevant stakeholders of the change.
# If the request is rejected, the project team will continue with the original scope.

<blockquote>It is important to have a formalized process for making changes to the scope baseline to ensure that the Tracking Activity Project Management System project stays on track and within budget. Any changes to the scope should be carefully assessed and approved to avoid scope creeps and keep the project on track.

<span id="cost-management-plan"></span>
= 7.3 Cost Management Plan  =

<span id="introduction-2"></span>
== 7.3.1 Introduction ==

The Cost Management Plan for Tracking Activity Project Management (TAPM) is to outline the approach that the project team will take to manage costs throughout the project. The plan outlines the methods that will be used to monitor and manage costs, such as budgeting, cost reporting, and cost estimations.

Cost management responsibilities:

* The Project Manager is responsible for developing and implementing the cost management plan.
* The Project Team is responsible for following the cost management plan and reporting any cost increase or problems.

Cost change approval:

* The Business Analyst is in charge with managing information by analyzing and compiling them to address potential issues in the project as well as create solutions.
* The Operational Analyst is responsible for examining the operational needs of the suggested solution and creating an implementation and strategy.
* The System Developer oversees handling the system of the application in case of an error or technical issues encountered in the system.

By adopting these approaches, the project team may efficiently manage expenses for a project that concentrates on TAPM by implementing these measures, ensuring that the project remains on track financially.

<span id="measuring-project-cost"></span>
== 7.3.3 Measuring Project Cost ==

The Project Tracking Monitoring System (TAPM) cost almost nothing and involved the creation of software using Laravel and Visual Studio, as well as GitHub, we will use Man-hours and hourly rate to measure and control our project costs. To estimate the cost of the project based on the given information, you can use the following formula:

''Total Cost = (Hourly Rate * 8 hours) * 30 days''

EXAMPLE:

# Assuming a junior programmer salary of 375 Pesos per hour, the cost of the project can be estimated as follows: Total cost per project phase = Hourly rate * 8 working hours * (Days of work) Total Cost = 3000 * 30 = 90,000 So, the estimated cost of the project based on the project phase duration for the junior programmer salary is 90,000 Pesos.

''Total Cost = (Hourly Rate * (8 hours * Total Working Days))''

The Formula above calculates the overall cost the personnel in the duration of the project cycles. However, please note that this is only an estimate, and the actual cost may vary based on factors such as project complexity, resource utilization, and unforeseen events. To forecast future project costs, we will review cost performance over time and across work packages or schedule activities. This will help us identify any potential cost overruns or deviations from our project plan. By measuring and monitoring our project costs, we can ensure that we stay on track and deliver our project within budget.

<span id="reporting-format"></span>
== 7.3.4 Reporting Format ==

The ideal reporting format at the cost management plan for the Project TAPM would be a financial report using a spreadsheet, excel, or table. This will include all the technical, maintenance, and for the hourly work of each member, information for the project budget that will be incurred.

In addition to that there are format that are easily understandable and helpful for the stakeholders and the project team, reporting is especially needed in seeing how much the expected cost and amount of a project, some helpful infographic can also be used upon reporting. The following formats would be used by TAPM, Executive Summary of the project cost and a Budget Overview of the total cost incurred it as well as infographics to make it presentable such as a bar chart.

<span id="cost-variance-response-process"></span>
== 7.3.5 Cost Variance Response Process ==

Cost variable response for project TAPM is in the following:

* Control Thresholds
** The Control Threshold for the TAPM project is a cost variance of more than 10% or less than -10%. If the project reaches one of these Control Thresholds, a Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan is required.
* Reporting
** the project team must report any cost variances to the Project Manager within two days of detection.
** Options for Corrective Action: Upon escalation, the Project Manager will present the increasing the budget for the project.
*** Reducing scope or quality
*** Revising the project schedule
*** Changing resource allocation â€“
* Selection of Corrective Action:
** Within three business days from when the Stakeholders selects a corrective action option, the Project Manager will present the Stakeholders with a formal Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan.

* Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan:
** The Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan will detail the actions necessary to bring the project back within budget and how the effectiveness of the actions in the plan will be measured. The plan will include:
*** A description of the corrective actions to be taken
*** A timeline for implementation of the actions
*** A budget for the actions

<span id="cost-change-control-process"></span>
== 7.3.6 Cost Change Control Process ==

The cost change control process for a project that focuses on TAPM includes:

# Identifying and documenting the change - Suggested changes to the budget of the project must be documented on a cost change request form.
# Evaluating the impact of the change - The project team will evaluate the changeâ€™s effect on the projectâ€™s cost after it has been documented.
# Approving of the change - The change request must be reviewed by the stakeholders, including the project sponsor. After approval, the change must be documented and shared with the project team.
# Updating the project plan - The project plan should be updated to reflect the change after it has been approved.
# Reporting on the cost change - The project team needs to keep updated on the cost of the project and report on any changes.

The cost change control process will be implemented to ensure that any changes that have an impact on the projectâ€™s cost are correctly assessed and documented by creating an effective cost change control approach. This can reduce the possibility of excess costs and guarantee that the project is completed within the budget.

<span id="project-budget"></span>
== 7.3.7 Project Budget ==

In the context of the TAPM project, a budget has been developed to ensure that all project costs are accounted for and managed throughout the project's life cycle. This budget will serve as a baseline for monitoring the project's financial performance and ensuring that it remains on track to meet its objectives within the approved budget.

The budget for this project is detailed below. The formula used to find the Total Cost monthly pay is Total Cost = (Hourly Rate * 8) * 30, Costs for this project are presented in various categories

== 7.4 Schedule Management Plan ==

<span id="introduction-3"></span>
=== 7.4.1 Introduction ===

Effective schedule management is essential for any project to succeed. The schedule management plan serves as a critical tool for project managers to ensure that projects are completed on time, within budget, and with the required quality standards. The plan outlines the approach, methods, and tools that will be used to develop and manage the project schedule. It defines the roles and responsibilities of the project team members involved in schedule management, and it establishes the procedures for monitoring and controlling schedule progress. In this document, we will provide a general description of the items that should be included in the schedule management plan. These items will be described in more detail in subsequent sections of the plan, where we will outline specific procedures and techniques for managing the project schedule.

<span id="schedule-management-approach"></span>
=== 7.4.2 Schedule Management Approach ===

The project team and allocated resources will carefully adhere to the initial schedule to avoid any delays that could affect the project's critical path. The approval of the project team and assets is necessary for the proposed work package task, activity durations, and overall project timeline. After obtaining the necessary approvals, the project advisor will review, approve, and establish the baseline schedule.

When modifications are implemented, the plans and baselines will be revised accordingly. Moreover, these revisions will be presented as outputs. The development strategy will have a significant influence on the scheduling approach, evaluation methods, tools, management, and control of the schedule.

<span id="the-following-are-the-roles-and-responsibilities-involved-in-developing-a-schedule"></span>
The following are the roles and responsibilities involved in developing a schedule:

<span id="schedule-control"></span>
=== 7.4.3 Schedule Control ===

Throughout the project, it is essential to handle the schedule meticulously and efficiently. The project manager assumes the responsibility of overseeing meetings, schedules, project updates, as well as any alterations to the project schedule. Additionally, the project manager ensures that the project client is consistently informed about the project's progress.

On the other hand, the project team is obligated to attend meetings where schedule updates are shared and collaborate on any necessary adjustments to the timetable. Each task completed by project team members should be accompanied by a discussion and presentation of the corresponding percentage of completion to the project team.

<span id="schedule-changes-and-threshold"></span>
=== 7.4.4 Schedule Changes and Threshold  ===

When creating the project schedule, it is crucial for the project sponsor to establish a deadline for project completion or operational readiness. This deadline serves to align the project client's objectives and expectations with the ongoing project. Poor schedule management is one factor that can lead to schedule changes, necessitating plan extensions or modifications. If circumstances arise that could potentially exceed the predetermined limits set by the project sponsor, it becomes necessary for the project manager to submit a schedule change request, which must obtain approval from the project sponsor before implementing the change.

If any of the following situations occur, a schedule change request must be submitted for approval to either the project stakeholder or the project manager, depending on the specific circumstances:

* If a proposed change aims to limit the length of deliverables within a given deadline during the project's development phase, it is important to emphasize that increasing the duration does not equate to extending the work across the entire duration.
* Changes to the scope statement need to be carefully considered to prevent conflicts during the project's documentation phase. If these changes result in a work package expansion of 5% or more, reflecting the updates across all project documentation, a schedule change request must be submitted.
* When an alternative approach suggests either reducing or extending the project's overall timetable by 10% or more, a schedule change request should be initiated.

<span id="scope-change"></span>
=== 7.4.5 Scope Change ===

When a significant problem occurs within the project that necessitates a substantial change in project scope, it is advisable to propose a change, exercising prudence during the process of suggesting and evaluating adjustments. Any member of the project team or the project client has the authority to request changes to the project's scope. To initiate a change request, a project change request document must be submitted to the project advisor, who will review the requested scope change. If the request does not align with the project's goals or schedule, the project advisor may reject it, or a meeting may be scheduled with the project client and team to discuss and assess its impact. Once the project client and advisor have initially approved the scope change, the project manager will communicate it to the entire team, who will then make necessary amendments to relevant paperwork, deliverables, and product backlogs in response to the change.

<span id="introduction-5"></span>
=== 7.6.1. Introduction ===

<blockquote>A well-structured plan for managing changes is essential to ensure the successful implementation of any project, such as the Tracking Activity Project Management system. This plan provides a systematic approach to identify, assess, and implement changes that may arise throughout the project. It guarantees that any alterations are thoroughly evaluated, align with the project's scope, and effectively communicated to all stakeholders.

The change management strategy includes a clear process for submitting, evaluating, and approving changes. This process is shared with all stakeholders, who are encouraged to request any modifications they deem necessary. The project team then evaluates these requests, considering their impact on the project's schedule, cost, and quality. Approved changes are executed in a controlled and organized manner, while rejected changes are documented and retained for future reference.

It is crucial to note that making alterations outside of the change management strategy can negatively affect the project's progress and outcome. Therefore, it is essential for all stakeholders to understand and adhere to the change management process. This adherence guarantees that the project stays on track and that any adjustments made contribute to the overall success of the project.

In conclusion, the project team will implement an agile risk management methodology that emphasizes ongoing improvement and flexibility. The effectiveness of the risk management plan will be regularly assessed and adjusted as needed to ensure the project's objectives and quality standards are achieved.

<span id="risk-mitigation-and-avoidance"></span>
== 7.9.7. Risk Mitigation and Avoidance ==

The project manager ensures to aid team leader in developing and improving responses to each identified risk. As more risks are identified, if the risk is qualified based on the metric established, the team must respond to develop avoidance and mitigation strategies to the risk. The identified risk will also be added to the risk register or in the table and the project plan to ensure that they are monitored when the work involves those risks.

The risk for the TAPM will be managed and controlled within the constraints of schedule, authority, and budget cost. All identified risks will be analyzed to determine how the risk will impact the time, scope, cost. The project manager, with the assistance of the project team will determine the efficient way to deal with each risk to ensure that everything goes according to plan. There will be cases where it will be necessary to allow the project to extend its budget cost. If only necessary to allow the TAPM Project for more resources to meet the deadline and requirements of the stakeholders.

<span id="risk-register"></span>
== 7.9.8. Risk Register ==

To effectively manage risks in the TAPM project, a comprehensive risk register will be maintained throughout the project. This register will include a detailed explanation of each risk, its likelihood, potential impacts, and any mitigation measures that have been implemented. Regular reviews and updates of the risk register will ensure its accuracy and relevance. Access to the risk register will be provided to all stakeholders and it will be stored in a centralized location.

The identified risk in the risk register, each risk has been classified and added to the project plan. When the work module contains a riskâ€”prior to when the risk is going to occur the project manager will assign a leader to ensure adherence to the agreed mitigation strategy. Each assigned leader will provide the status of the risk relevant to their group in their daily project meeting.
