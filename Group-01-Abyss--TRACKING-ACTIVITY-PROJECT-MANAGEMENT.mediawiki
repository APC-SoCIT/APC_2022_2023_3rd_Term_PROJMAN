==Project Approval Requirements==
<br>
<p>The Tracking Activity Project Management system will be considered successful when a working system, comprising at least 70% of its intended functionality, has been tested and deemed acceptable for implementation in the Asia Pacific Colleges’ Project Development Office. Once the 70% working system is achieved, the client will receive a recommendation list, enabling them to further enhance and refine the submitted system in terms of both system functionality and potential security threats. Ultimately, the client will evaluate and authorize the completion of the project, thereby determining its success.</p>
<br>
==Project Manager==
<p>Noreen Keziah Sioco has been appointed as the Project Manager for the Tracking Activity Project Management system. In this role, Ms. Sioco is accountable for overseeing all project tasks, scheduling, and communication related to the Tracking Activity Project Management system. She leads a team consisting of her fellow peers from school. Ms. Sioco will collaborate with the client to address their project requirements effectively. Additionally, she has the authority to approve budget expenditures within the allocated budget amounts. Ms. Sioco is responsible for providing weekly updates to both the Project Sponsor and the client, ensuring regular progress reports are shared.</p>
<br>

=Project Management Approach=
<p>The Project Sponsor possesses complete authority to authorize the implementation of plans and any necessary modifications. Conversely, the Project Manager is accountable for overseeing and executing the project in alignment with the established Project Plan. The project team will be composed of individuals from various departments, including administration, product development, and quality assurance.<br>
The Project Manager will collaborate with all available resources to conduct project planning. The project sponsor will thoroughly assess and endorse all project and subsidiary management plans. Additionally, the project sponsor will make all funding decisions. If approval authority is delegated to the project manager, a written agreement signed by both the project sponsor and project manager is required.</p>

=Project Technical Support=
<p>In implementing the Tracking Activity Project Management, our strategic approach is grounded in a comprehensive evaluation of the project's requisites and limitations. Our team will adhere to a meticulously planned and flexible product development methodology, specifically designed to guarantee the punctual delivery of an exceptional product that aligns with the client's envisioned outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Product Development Methodology</b></p>
<p>Our product management approach combines elements of both agile and traditional project management frameworks to optimize the development process. By leveraging agile methods like Scrum, we can achieve rapid iterations and incorporate continuous feedback from stakeholders.<br>
Concurrently, we will utilize traditional project management methods such as Waterfall to ensure timely delivery and adherence to budgetary constraints.<br>
The methodology encompasses the following sequential steps:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Project Initiation: This phase involves identifying the project goals, stakeholders, and overall scope. We establish clear objectives and define the project's initial requirements and constraints.</li>
   <li>Planning: In this stage, we create a comprehensive project plan that outlines tasks, timelines, resource allocation, and communication strategies. The plan serves as a roadmap for the project's execution and guides decision- making throughout.</li>
   <li>Execution: During the execution phase, we carry out the planned activities, develop the product, and implement the necessary processes. Agile practices, like Scrum, enable iterative development, regular team collaboration, and frequent feedback from stakeholders.</li>
   <li>Monitoring and Controlling: Throughout the project, we continually monitor progress, track key performance indicators, and assess adherence to the project plan. By closely managing resources, risks, and dependencies, we can proactively address any issues or deviations.</li>
   <li>Closure: Once the product is developed and meets the specified criteria, we conclude the project. This involves finalizing documentation, conducting final reviews, obtaining client approval, and transitioning the product to the appropriate stakeholders or operational teams</li>
</ol>

<p>Throughout the product development life cycle, we emphasize continuous communication with the client to ensure their needs are met and to provide regular updates on project progress. Additionally, we prioritize user experience and design, aiming to create an intuitive and user-friendly product that aligns with customer expectations.<br>
By combining agile and traditional project management approaches, we can leverage the benefits of iterative development, stakeholder collaboration, and efficient project control. This hybrid methodology allows us to deliver high- quality products within specified timelines and budgetary constraints.</p>

<p><b>Technical Architecture</b></p>
<p>The Tracking Activity Project Management system will be developed using the Laravel Framework, which offers an expressive and elegant syntax and provides various features necessary for building modern web applications. This includes routing, validation, caching, queues, and file storage capabilities.<br>
For the user interface, modern front-end technologies such as Bootstrap will be utilized. This will ensure a responsive and intuitive experience for users. In the back end, a combination of Node.js and PHP syntax will be employed to create a robust and reliable system.<br>
The technical architecture of the project management system follows a client-server model, where the client is a web browser, and the server is the application server. The server-side will be developed and hosted using the XAMPP web server. The application will adhere to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture provided by the Laravel Framework.<br>
The Model component represents the data and business logic of the application. In Laravel, models are PHP classes that interact with the database, defining table structures and providing methods for data querying and manipulation. The View component is responsible for presenting data to users and represents the user interface. Laravel utilizes the Blade templating engine for creating clean and readable templates with dynamic content. The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user requests, interacts with the Model to retrieve or update data, and passes the data to the View for display. Laravel's Controllers are PHP classes that manage the logic of different HTTP requests.<br>
To ensure application security, the technical architecture incorporates Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection. Laravel automatically generates and verifies CSRF tokens for HTML forms submitted to the application. This safeguards against CSRF attacks, where attackers trick users into submitting malicious requests on their behalf.<br>
Scalability is a key consideration in technical architecture. Load balancers, clustering, and other scalability techniques will be implemented to accommodate future growth and expansion.<br>
In summary, the technical architecture of the Tracking Activity Project Management system focuses on robustness, security, and scalability. It leverages the Laravel Framework, modern front-end technologies, and a client-server model to deliver a reliable and efficient application.<br></p>

=Stakeholder Management Strategy=
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>A stakeholder management strategy serves as a cornerstone for project success. Within the context of the current project charter, which empowers the Project Development Office (PDO) of Asia Pacific College to establish a collaborative platform for monitoring, tracking, and generating reports on projects assigned to student groups in collaboration with industry partners, an encompassing stakeholder management strategy is crucial. The PDO endeavors to closely collaborate with project proponents to formulate a comprehensive project plan that encompasses various essential components, including provisions for effective stakeholder management. The overarching objective is to ensure that all stakeholders are not only adequately identified but also actively engaged and proficiently managed throughout the project's entire lifecycle.</p>
<p><b>Identify Stakeholders</b></p>
<p>The stakeholders for the project include the following groups:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Project Development Office (PDO) staff</li>
   <li>Proponents of the project</li>
   <li>Student groups assigned to the project.</li>
   <li>Industry partners</li>
   <li>Project sponsors</li>
   <li>Faculty members</li>
   <li>End-users of the project outcomes</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>To identify stakeholders, the project team will employ a methodology that involves analyzing the project's goals, objectives, and requirements, and then mapping these to potential stakeholders who may be impacted by the project. The project team will also consult with key stakeholders to identify additional stakeholders and obtain feedback on stakeholder identification. All stakeholders will be defined based on their level of interest, influence, and involvement in the project. Great care and effort will be dedicated to ensuring that all stakeholders are identified and engaged throughout the project's lifecycle.</p>

<p><b>Key Stakeholders</b></p>
<p>These stakeholders have been identified as key stakeholders because they potentially have the most influence over the project or may be most affected by the project. Additionally, they may be stakeholders who are resistant to the change represented by the project. Due to their significance, these key stakeholders may require more communication and management throughout the project's lifecycle. It is important to identify them to seek their feedback on their desired level of participation and communication to ensure that their concerns are addressed, and their needs are met. This helps to increase stakeholder engagement, improve project outcomes, and increase the likelihood of success.</p>

<p><b>Stakeholder Analysis</b></p>
<p>To analyze the list of identified stakeholders, the project team will categorize, or group stakeholders based on their level of interest, power, influence, and involvement in the project. This helps to determine the level of impact each stakeholder may have on the project and inform the team's communication and engagement strategies.</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The success of any project depends on the effective management of its scope. The Tracking Activity Project Management team recognizes the significance of a comprehensive scope management plan in ensuring the project's success. Taking inspiration from the best practices and cutting-edge tools used in the Tracking Activity Project Management system, the team has created a Scope Management Plan that outlines the procedures and strategies that will be employed to define, document, and control the project's scope. By leveraging agile methodologies and real-time collaboration tools, the team aims to deliver a top-notch tracking activity management system that meets the needs and expectations of all stakeholders involved. This document serves as a guide for the team to execute the project successfully while maintaining the project's scope within the predefined limits.<p> 

<p><b>Scope Definition:</b> To define the scope of the Tracking Activity Project Management, the team will undertake the following activities:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Requirements gathering:</b>A range of methods will be utilized to collect and document the requirements of the system. These will include interviewing stakeholders, organizing focus groups, and using online surveys.</li>
  <li><b>User Stories:</b> The team will develop user stories that outline the system's required functionality from an end-user perspective. The stories will be prioritized according to their business value and will guide the project's development process.</li>
  <li><b>Scope statement:</b>  The scope statement will be developed based on the user stories and requirements gathered. It will provide a high-level overview of the project scope, outlining the deliverables, exclusions, and constraints.</li>
  <li><b>Scope baseline:</b> The scope baseline will be developed by incorporating the scope statement and user stories into the project management plan. It will be regularly updated to reflect any changes in scope that may arise during the project's progress.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Scope Documentation:</b> To document the scope of the Tracking Activity Project Management, the team will undertake the following activities:<p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Requirements documentation:</b> To document the scope of the Tracking Activity Project Management, the team will undertake the following activities:</li>
  <li><b>Project management plan:</b> The project management plan will include details about the scope of the project, including the scope statement and the scope baseline. The plan will also cover any other relevant information about the project scope, such as deliverables, exclusions, and constraints.</li>
  <li><b>Change log:</b> TA change log will be maintained to keep track of all changes made to the scope of the project. This log will document the details of the change, its impact on the project, and the required approvals. The change log will be regularly updated to ensure that all changes are captured and appropriately managed.</li>
<ol>

<p><b>Scope Verification</b></p>
<p>To ensure that the deliverables of the Tracking Activity Project Management System project align with the original project scope, the project team will employ various methods for scope verification. These methods will involve:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Quality checklist:</b> 
   A list of specific requirements for each deliverable to be accepted. The project team will use these checklists to ensure that all deliverables meet the necessary criteria before proceeding.
</li>
  <li><b>Work performance measurements:</b>
   The project team will monitor and measure the progress of each deliverable during development. This will enable them to identify and resolve any potential issues or deviations from the original scope in a timely manner.
</li>
  <li><b>Scope baseline:</b>
   The project team will maintain a scope baseline, which is a snapshot of the original project scope. Any modifications to the scope must be documented and approved before they can be implemented. The scope baseline will be utilized to confirm that the final deliverables align with the original scope.
</li>
  <li><b>Formal acceptance:</b> 
   The project sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders will formally accept each deliverable upon completion. This ensures that the project team meets the expectations of all relevant parties — allowing for any necessary feedback or changes to be made promptly.
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Scope Control</b></p>
<p>The scope control process for the Tracking Activity Project Management System project will involve regular reviews of the project's deliverables and progress to ensure that they align with the original project scope as defined in the Project Scope Statement. Any deviations from the scope will be evaluated and, if necessary, changes to the scope will be documented and approved through the established scope change process. The Project Manager will be responsible for monitoring and controlling the project's scope, with assistance from the project team and stakeholders. Periodic reviews of the project's scope will be conducted to ensure that the project remains on track and within the defined boundaries. The project manager will also be responsible for ensuring that any scope changes are properly documented and that all impacted parties are notified of any changes.
<br>
<strong>The scope control process for the Tracking Activity Project Management System project will involve the following steps for making changes to the scope baseline:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>A scope change request will be initiated by any stakeholder or team member who identifies a need for a change to the scope.</li>
  <li>The scope change request will be reviewed by the Project manager and the Project Sponsor to assess the impact of the change on the project schedule, budget, and resources.</li>
  <li>If the change is deemed low impact, the Project Manager can approve or deny the request. If the change is deemed high impact, the Project manager can approve or deny the request. Any low impact change request approved or denied by the Project Manager can be reviewed and overruled by the Project Sponsor.</li>
  <li>If the request is approved, the Project Manager will create an action plan to proceed with the change, update the scope baseline, and notify all relevant stakeholders of the change.</li>
  <li>If the request is rejected, the project team will continue with the original scope.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to have a formalized process for making changes to the scope baseline to ensure that the Tracking Activity Project Management System project stays on track and within budget. Any changes to the scope should be carefully assessed and approved to avoid scope creeps and keep the project on track.</p>


=Cost Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Cost Management Plan for Tracking Activity Project Management (TAPM) is to outline the approach that the project team will take to manage costs throughout the project. The plan outlines the methods that will be used to monitor and manage costs, such as budgeting, cost reporting, and cost estimations.

<br><br>Cost management responsibilities:

<ul>
  <li>The Project Manager is responsible for developing and implementing the cost management plan.</li>
  <li>The Project Team is responsible for following the cost management plan and reporting any cost increase or problems.</li>
</ul>

Cost change approval:
<ul>
  <li>The Business Analyst is in charge with managing information by analyzing and compiling them to address potential issues in the project as well as create solutions.</li>
  <li>The Operational Analyst is responsible for examining the operational needs of the suggested solution and creating an implementation and strategy.</li>
  <li>The System Developer oversees handling the system of the application in case of an error or technical issues encountered in the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>By adopting these approaches, the project team may efficiently manage expenses for a project that concentrates on TAPM by implementing these measures, ensuring that the project remains on track financially.</p>


==Measuring Project Cost==
<p>The Project Tracking Monitoring System (TAPM) cost almost nothing and involved the creation of software using Laravel and Visual Studio, as well as GitHub, we will use Man-hours and hourly rate to measure and control our project costs. To estimate the cost of the project based on the given information, you can use the following formula:</p>

<p><em>Total Cost = (Hourly Rate * 8 hours) * 30 days</em></p>

<p>EXAMPLE:</p>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li>Assuming a junior programmer salary of 375 Pesos per hour, the cost of the project can be estimated as follows: Total cost per project phase = Hourly rate * 8 working hours * (Days of work) Total Cost = 3000 * 30 = 90,000 So, the estimated cost of the project based on the project phase duration for the junior programmer salary is 90,000 Pesos.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p><em>Total Cost = (Hourly Rate * (8 hours * Total Working Days))</em></p>

<p>The Formula above calculates the overall cost the personnel in the duration of the project cycles. However, please note that this is only an estimate, and the actual cost may vary based on factors such as project complexity, resource utilization, and unforeseen events. To forecast future project costs, we will review cost performance over time and across work packages or schedule activities. This will help us identify any potential cost overruns or deviations from our project plan. By measuring and monitoring our project costs, we can ensure that we stay on track and deliver our project within budget.</p>

==Reporting Format==
<p>
The ideal reporting format at the cost management plan for the Project TAPM would be a financial report using a spreadsheet, excel, or table. This will include all the technical, maintenance, and for the hourly work of each member, information for the project budget that will be incurred.<br>
In addition to that there are format that are easily understandable and helpful for the stakeholders and the project team, reporting is especially needed in seeing how much the expected cost and amount of a project, some helpful infographic can also be used upon reporting. The following formats would be used by TAPM, Executive Summary of the project cost and a Budget Overview of the total cost incurred it as well as infographics to make it presentable such as a bar chart.<br>
</p>

==Cost Variance Response Process==
<p>Cost variable response for project TAPM is in the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Control Thresholds
        <ol>
            <li>The Control Threshold for the TAPM project is a cost variance of more than 10% or less than -10%. If the project reaches one of these Control Thresholds, a Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan is required.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Reporting
        <ol>
            <li>the project team must report any cost variances to the Project Manager within two days of detection.</li>
            <li>Options for Corrective Action: Upon escalation, the Project Manager will present the increasing the budget for the project.
                <ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>A description of the corrective actions to be taken</li>
                    <li>A timeline for implementation of the actions</li>
                    <li>A budget for the actions</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

==Cost Change Control Process==
<p>The cost change control process for a project that focuses on TAPM includes:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Identifying and documenting the change - Suggested changes to the budget of the project must be documented on a cost change request form.</li>
    <li>Evaluating the impact of the change - The project team will evaluate the change&rsquo;s effect on the project&rsquo;s cost after it has been documented.</li>
    <li>Approving of the change - The change request must be reviewed by the stakeholders, including the project sponsor. After approval, the change must be documented and shared with the project team.</li>
    <li>Updating the project plan - The project plan should be updated to reflect the change after it has been approved.</li>
    <li>Reporting on the cost change - The project team needs to keep updated on the cost of the project and report on any changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>The cost change control process will be implemented to ensure that any changes that have an impact on the project&rsquo;s cost are correctly assessed and documented by creating an effective cost change control approach. This can reduce the possibility of excess costs and guarantee that the project is completed within the budget.</p>

==Project Budget==
<p>In the context of the TAPM project, a budget has been developed to ensure that all project costs are accounted for and managed throughout the project&apos;s life cycle. This budget will serve as a baseline for monitoring the project&apos;s financial performance and ensuring that it remains on track to meet its objectives within the approved budget.</p>
<p>The budget for this project is detailed below. The formula used to find the Total Cost monthly pay is Total Cost = (Hourly Rate * 8) * 30, Costs for this project are presented in various categories</p>

=Schedule  Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>Effective schedule management is essential for any project to succeed. The schedule management plan serves as a critical tool for project managers to ensure that projects are completed on time, within budget, and with the required quality standards. The plan outlines the approach, methods, and tools that will be used to develop and manage the project schedule. It defines the roles and responsibilities of the project team members involved in schedule management, and it establishes the procedures for monitoring and controlling schedule progress. In this document, we will provide a general description of the items that should be included in the schedule management plan. These items will be described in more detail in subsequent sections of the plan, where we will outline specific procedures and techniques for managing the project schedule.</p>

==Schedule Management Approach==
<p>The project team and allocated resources will carefully adhere to the initial schedule to avoid any delays that could affect the project's critical path. The approval of the project team and assets is necessary for the proposed work package task, activity durations, and overall project timeline. After obtaining the necessary approvals, the project advisor will review, approve, and establish the baseline schedule.</p>

==Schedule Control==
<p>Throughout the project, it is essential to handle the schedule meticulously and efficiently. The project manager assumes the responsibility of overseeing meetings, schedules, project updates, as well as any alterations to the project schedule. Additionally, the project manager ensures that the project client is consistently informed about the project&apos;s progress.</p>
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the project team is obligated to attend meetings where schedule updates are shared and collaborate on any necessary adjustments to the timetable. Each task completed by project team members should be accompanied by a discussion and presentation of the corresponding percentage of completion to the project team.</p>
<br>

==Schedule Changes and Thresholds==
<p>When creating the project schedule, it is crucial for the project sponsor to establish a deadline for project completion or operational readiness. This deadline serves to align the project client's objectives and expectations with the ongoing project. Poor schedule management is one factor that can lead to schedule changes, necessitating plan extensions or modifications. If circumstances arise that could potentially exceed the predetermined limits set by the project sponsor, it becomes necessary for the project manager to submit a schedule change request, which must obtain approval from the project sponsor before implementing the change.</p>
<br>
<p>If any of the following situations occur, a schedule change request must be submitted for approval to either the project stakeholder or the project manager, depending on the specific circumstances: </p>
<ul>
    <li>If a proposed change aims to limit the length of deliverables within a given deadline during the project's development phase, it is important to emphasize that increasing the duration does not equate to extending the work across the entire duration.</li>
    <li>Changes to the scope statement need to be carefully considered to prevent conflicts during the project's documentation phase. If these changes result in a work package expansion of 5% or more, reflecting the updates across all project documentation, a schedule change request must be submitted.</li>
    <li>When an alternative approach suggests either reducing or extending the project's overall timetable by 10% or more, a schedule change request should be initiated.</li>
</ul>

==Scope Change==
<p>When a significant problem occurs within the project that necessitates a substantial change in project scope, it is advisable to propose a change, exercising prudence during the process of suggesting and evaluating adjustments. Any member of the project team or the project client has the authority to request changes to the project's scope. To initiate a change request, a project change request document must be submitted to the project advisor, who will review the requested scope change. If the request does not align with the project's goals or schedule, the project advisor may reject it, or a meeting may be scheduled with the project client and team to discuss and assess its impact. Once the project client and advisor have initially approved the scope change, the project manager will communicate it to the entire team, who will then make necessary amendments to relevant paperwork, deliverables, and product backlogs in response to the change. </p>

=Staffing Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>Any project&apos;s success depends on a solid management plan. It helps to ensure that the right people with the correct qualifications are in the right place at the right time and serves as a model for how the project team will be managed and organized. The strategy includes roles and responsibilities, communication procedures, and performance management standards. With the help of this plan, the project manager and project team can manage the project in an efficient manner, making sure that everyone on the team is aware of their duties and responsibilities, that communication is clear and effective, and that performance is tracked and managed in a way that supports the project&apos;s success as a whole.</p>
<br>

==Roles and Responsibilities==
<p>Any project must have a strong management plan in place to be successful. To ensure that everyone is aware of their particular contributions and how they fit into the larger picture, it explains the roles and responsibilities of all project team members and stakeholders. The plan also specifies each team member&apos;s level of authority and decision-making capacity, ensuring that resources are distributed and used efficiently. The strategy guarantees that the right people are in the right roles to accomplish project success by explicitly identifying competences and skill needs.</p>

=Change Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>A well-structured plan for managing changes is essential to ensure the successful implementation of any project, such as the Tracking Activity Project Management system. This plan provides a systematic approach to identify, assess, and implement changes that may arise throughout the project. It guarantees that any alterations are thoroughly evaluated, align with the project&apos;s scope, and effectively communicated to all stakeholders.</p><br>
<p>The change management strategy includes a clear process for submitting, evaluating, and approving changes. This process is shared with all stakeholders, who are encouraged to request any modifications they deem necessary. The project team then evaluates these requests, considering their impact on the project&apos;s schedule, cost, and quality. Approved changes are executed in a controlled and organized manner, while rejected changes are documented and retained for future reference.</p><br>
<p>It is crucial to note that making alterations outside of the change management strategy can negatively affect the project&apos;s progress and outcome. Therefore, it is essential for all stakeholders to understand and adhere to the change management process. This adherence guarantees that the project stays on track and that any adjustments made contribute to the overall success of the project.</p><br>

==Change Control Board==

<p>The Change Control Board comprises a specific group of stakeholders who are accountable for approving or rejecting changes related to the Tracking Activity Project Management System. The following table provides a concise overview of each individual who serves on the Change Control Board:</p>
