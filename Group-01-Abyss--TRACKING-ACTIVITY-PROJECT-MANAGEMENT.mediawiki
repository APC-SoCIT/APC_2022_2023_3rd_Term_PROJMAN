<h2>Stakeholder Plan Updates</h2>



=Scope Management Plan=


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The  Stakeholder  Management  Strategy  for  the  project  charter,  which  authorizes  the Project  Development  Office  (PDO)  of  Asia  Pacific  College  to  create  a  collaborative platform  to  monitor,  track,  participate  and  generate  reports  for  projects  assigned  to student groups in partnership with industry partners. The PDO aims to work closely with proponents   to   develop   a   project   plan   that   includes   provisions   for   stakeholder management,  among  other  key  project  components.  The  goal  is  to  ensure  that  all stakeholders are adequately identified, engaged and managed throughout the project's lifecycle.  The  successful  implementation  of  the  Stakeholder  Management  Strategy  will enable  the  PDO  to  gain  stakeholder  support,  prevent  conflicts,  and  enhance  project outcomes.</p>

<h2>Scope Management Approach</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Authority and responsibility for scope management will be held by Noreen Keziah S.  Sioco,  the project  manager  of  group Abyss. She will  closely  collaborate  with the project sponsor, Mr. Jayvee Cabardo, and other key stakeholders to establish and manage the project's scope.
</li>
<li>
The  scope  of  the  project  will  be  defined  by  creating  a  Scope  Statement,  Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, and a detailed Statement of Work (SOW). These documents will comprehensively describe the project deliverables, tasks,  and  requirements,  and  will  be  reviewed  and  endorsed  by  the  project sponsor and other stakeholders before the project work commences.
</li>
<li>
The scope of the project will be measured and verified by using quality checklists, work  performance  measurements,  and  regular  reviews  of  the  project's  progress against  the  scope  baseline.  Any  deviations  from  the  scope  baseline  will  be identified and addressed through the scope change process.
</li>
<li>
The  scope  change  process  for  the  Tracking  Activity  Project  Management  will require  the  submission  of a  scope  change  request  by  Mr.  Jayvee  Cabardo,  with final approval granted by the project sponsor. Any changes to theproject's scope will  be  evaluated  carefully  to  ensure  that  they  align  with  the  project's  objectives and do not have a negative impact on the project schedule or budget.
</li>
<li>
The  project's  final  deliverables  will  be  accepted  and  approved  by  the  project sponsor and other key stakeholders, with Mr. Jayvee Cabardo being responsible for   verifying   that   all   project   requirements   have   been   satisfied.   Successful completion  of  the  project  will  be  confirmed  once  all  deliverables  have  been accepted, and any unresolved issues have been resolved.
</li>
</ol>

<h2> Scope Definition </h2>

<p>The  scope  of  this  project  aims  to  address  the  issues  faced  by  Mr.  Jayvee  Cabardo  in using  multiple  tracking  systems  and  checking  various  projects  simultaneously.  The project   will   focus   on   developing  a   system   that   enables   Mr.   Cabardo   and   other stakeholders,  such  as  students,  teachers,  and  consultants/advisors,  to  create  and manage   multiple   student   group   projects   simultaneously.   The   system   will   be implemented at Asia Pacific College (APC) and will ensure that projects are completed on time.</p>

<h2> Project Scope Statement </h2>
<ul>
	<li>The Just-In-Time Website overall includes the design, functionality, and testing of the project for an E-Commerce Website. Additionality, will automate the transaction between the Customer to Distributor, and Distributor to Logistics. the payment gateway will be required to be implemented for the transaction to materialized into data entry while all the operations is processing in the background the effects of the automation of the transaction leads to reducing of inventory cost of the company.</li>
	<li>The Just-In-Time Website will also include Analytics for the Marketing and Sales of the company to provide better business decisions in the company. Due to the time constraint of three months of planning, analysis, and development the project is forced to reduce the amount of work per sprint.</li>
	<li>The project team and client agreed upon on the requirements of the website to be at the prototype stage with the agreed modules implement to the website which are the automation and the sales report analytics as well as the common functionality of an E-Commerce Website which are Shopping Cart, User Authentication, and Order Item. Better Designs can be implemented in other iteration of the project.</li>
	<li>This project does not include ongoing operations and maintenance cost of the website since the development team can benefit from the student development tools sponsored by their respective colleges.</li>
	<li>Bank-to-Bank method of payment gateway the project team and client agreed to avoid the work since the module requires the project team to apply credit cards transaction.</li>
	<li>The project is not to exceed 180 days in duration, on the days of development will only use development tools, Environment, and equipment available to us. Assumptions for this project are that support will be provided by the project client, adviser, and all department managers and that information, data, as well as adequate resources are available for the successful completion of this project.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Work Breakdown Structure </h2>

<p>The  Work  Breakdown  Structure  (WBS)  is  a  tool  that  will  be  used  to  divide  the  project into  smaller,  more  manageable  components.  This  hierarchical  representation  of  the project  scope  will  start  with  a  high-level  view  of  the  project  and  progressively  move down to a more detailed view. A companion document to the WBS, known as the WBS Dictionary,   will   provide   detailed   information about   each   component,   including deliverables, scope of work, responsibilities, and other relevant information. By  using  the  WBS  and  WBS  Dictionary,  the  project  team  will  be  able  to  assign responsibilities  for  each  component  of  the  project,  track  progress, and  ensure  that  all aspects of the project are accounted for. The WBS and WBS Dictionary will also help to identify and resolve issues and keep the project on track and within scope. The project team recognizes that the WBS and WBS Dictionary are essential tools for managing the project scope and ensuring the project's success.</p>

<h2> Scope Verification </h2>

<p>To  ensure  that  the  deliverables  of  the  Tracking  Activity  Project  Management  System project  align  with  the  original  project  scope,  the  project  team  will  employ  various methods for scope verification. These methods will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Quality checklists: A list of specific requirements for each deliverable to be accepted. The project team will use  these  checklists  to  ensure  that  all  deliverables  meet  the  necessary  criteria  before proceeding.
</li>
<li>
Work performance measurements: The  project  team will  monitor  and  measure  the  progress  of  each  deliverable  during development.  This  will  enable  them  to  identify  and  resolve  any  potential  issues  or deviations from the original scope in a timely manner.
</li>
<li>
Scope baseline: The  project  team  will  maintain  a scope  baseline,  which  is  a  snapshot  of  the  original project  scope.  Any  modifications  to  the  scope  must  be  documented  and  approved before they can be implemented. The scope baseline will be utilized to confirm that the final deliverables align with the original scope.
</li>
<li>
Formal acceptance: The  project  sponsor,  customer,  and  other  stakeholders  will  formally  accept  each deliverable upon completion. This ensures that the project team meets the expectations of  all  relevant  parties —allowing  for  any  necessary feedback  or  changes  to  be  made promptly.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall,   constant   communication   and   collaboration   with   the   customer   and   other stakeholders is essential throughout the project to ensure that the deliverables align with the original scope and are accepted formally.</p>

<h2> Scope Control </h2>

<p>The scope control process for the Tracking Activity Project Management System project will involve regular reviews of the project's deliverables and progress to ensure that they align  with  the  original  project  scope  as  defined  in  the  Project  Scope  Statement.  Any deviations from the scope will be evaluated and, if necessary, changes to the scope will be  documented  and  approved  through  the  established  scope  change  process.  The Project  Manager  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  and  controlling  the  project's  scope, with assistance from the project team and stakeholders. Periodic reviews of the project's scope  will  be  conducted  to  ensure  that  the  project  remains  on  track  and  within  the defined boundaries. The project manager will also be responsible for ensuring that any scope  changes  are  properly  documented  and  that  all  impacted  parties  are  notified  of any changes.</p>

<h2> Scope Change </h2>

<p>The scope control process for the Tracking Activity Project Management System project will involve the following steps for making changes to the scope baseline:</p>
<ol>
<li>
A scope change request will be initiated by any stakeholder or team member who identifies a need for a change to the scope.
</li>
<li>
The  scope  change  request  will  be  reviewed  by  the  Project  manager  and  the Project  Sponsor  to  assess  the  impact  of  the  change  on  the  project  schedule, budget, and resources.
</li>
<li>
If  the  change  is  deemed  low  impact,  the  Project  Manager  can  approve  or  deny the  request.  If  the  change  is  deemed  high  impact,  the  Project  manager  can approve or deny the request. Any low impact change request approved or denied by the Project Manager can be reviewed and overruled by the Project Sponsor.
</li>
<li>
If  the  request  is  approved,  the  Project  Manager  will  create  an  action  plan  to proceed  with  the  change,  update  the  scope  baseline, and  notify  all  relevant stakeholders of the change.
</li>
<li>
If the request is rejected, the project team will continue with the original scope.
</li>
<li>
It  is  important  to  have a  formalized  process  for  making  changes  to  the  scope baseline to ensure that the Tracking Activity Project Management System project stays on track and within budget. Any changes to the scope should be carefully assessed and approved to avoid scope creeps and keep the project on track.
</li>
</ol>

=Cost Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Cost Management Plan for Tracking Activity Project Management (TAPM) is to outline the  approach  that  the  project  team  will  take  to  manage  costs  throughout  the  project.  The  plan outlines  the  methods  that  will  be  used  to  monitor  and  manage  costs,  such  as  budgeting,  cost reporting, and cost estimations.</p>
 
<p>Cost management responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The   Project   Manager   is   responsible   for   developing   and   implementing   the   cost management plan.
</li>
<li>
The  project  Team  is  responsible  for  following  the  cost  management  plan  and  reporting any cost increase or problems.
</li>

<p>Cost change approval:</p>

<li>
Submitted suggestions must be approved first by the Project Manager before executing.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost Management Approach</h2>

<p>The cost management approach for the tracking activity and project management system project will be based on these approaches including:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Cost Estimates: The team will develop cost estimates for the various activities and tasks that can help  to  detect  potential  cost  overruns  and  give  a  starting  point  for  monitoring actual costs as the project moves forward.
</li>
<li>
Resource Allocation: Properly  distributing  resources  can  contribute  to  cost  reduction  by  ensuring  that resources are being used effectively and efficiently.
</li>
<li>
Budgeting: Making  a  budget  that  aligns  with  cost  estimates  can  ensure  that  the  project remains financially on course.
</li>
<li>
Risk Management: Managing  risks  that  could  impact  project  costs  is  another  salient  aspect  of  cost management.  This  involves  developing  an  approach  to  risk  management  as  well as maintaining updated on prospective risks throughout the project lifecycle. 
</li>
<li>
Cost Reporting: The  project  team  will  report  regularly  the  project  costs  and  progress  within  the budget,  which  can  assist  in  identifying  problems  early  on  and  give  the  project team   the   knowledge   they   need   to   make   wise   decisions   regarding   cost management.

<p>By  adopting  these  approaches,  the  project  team  may  efficiently  manage  expenses  for  a  project that concentrates on tracking activity and project management by implementing these measures, ensuring that the project remains on track financially.</p>

<h2>Measuring Project Costs</h2>

<p>The Project Tracking and Monitoring System (TAPM) cost almost nothing and involved the creation of software using Laravel and Visual Studio, as well as GitHub, we will use Man-hours and hourly rate to measure and control our project costs.</p>

<p>To estimate the cost of the project based on the given information, you can use the following formula:</p>

<pr>Total Cost = Number of Man-Hours * Hourly Rate <br>
Assuming a junior programmer salary of 375 Pesos per hour, the cost of the project can be estimated as follows:</pr>

<p>Total Number of Man-Hours = 40 hours/week * 13 weeks = 520 Hours <br>
Total Cost = 520 Hours * 375/hour = 195000</p>

<p>So, the estimated cost of the project based on man-hours and junior programmer salary is 195000 Pesos. However, please note that this is only an estimate, and the actual cost may vary based on factors such as project complexity, resource utilization, and unforeseen events.</p>

<p>To forecast future project costs, we will review cost performance over time and across work packages or schedule activities. This will help us identify any potential cost overruns or deviations from our project plan. By measuring and monitoring our project costs, we can ensure that we stay on track and deliver our project within budget.</p>

<h2>Reporting Format</h2>

<p>The ideal reporting format at the cost management plan for the Project Tracking and Monitoring System would be a financial report using a spreadsheet, excel, or table. This will include all the technical, maintenance, and for the hourly work of each member, inforamtion for the project budget that will be incurred.</p>
<p>In addition to that there are format that are easily understandable and helpful for the stakeholders and theproject team, reporting is especially needed in seeing how much the expected cost and amount of a project, some helpful infographic can also be used upon reporting. The following formats can be used for the project Tracking and Monitoring System:</p>

<p>Once the schedule is baselined as a major aspect of progressive elaboration, defining activities later may uncover new extension that was not envisaged previously. This ought to be taken care of through formal change control. Thus, change ask for is added to the is procedure as additional outputs. At the point when such changes are joined the plans and baselines will experience updates. The same are reflected as additional outputs. The development approach will altogether impact planning approach, evaluating methods, devices and how the schedule is managed and controlled.</p>

<h2>Schedule Control</h2>

<h2>Schedule Changes and Thresholds</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The recommended change is reducing the duration or deliverables of an individual Sprint Backlog in developing phase in the project, or increasing the duration of individual Sprint Backlog by 10% or more, to clarify adding it to the duration not extending the work over all duration.</li>
	<li>Changes in the scope statement shall be considered to prevent inconsistencies in the documentation phase of the project. The project team must compile all the inconsistencies in the document before increasing the work packages by 5% or more to update the changes in all of documentation.</li>
	<li>Another approach to the change is either to reduce the duration of the overall project schedule by 10% or more, or increase the duration of the overall project schedule by 2% or more.</li>

<h2>Staffing Management</h2>
<h2>Staff Acquisition:</h2>
<p>            For the JIT Project, the project staff will consist of three teams; the Project Management Team, Development Team, and Quality Team. The planning stage is where the project team would outsource and contract members or external entities that would aid the project team to success. The Project Manager will negotiate with the functional leaders in the team to identify required skills and resources that must be allocated in accordance with the project management structure. All staff and resources must be approved by the relevant functional leader before the staff and resources may begin any project work. The project team will share location of the project to ensure the consistency throughout the whole project.</p>
<h2>Resource Calendars:  </h2>
<p>            The JIT Project development will last for ten months including the planning, quality testing, and closeout documents. All resources must be identified and evaluated before the project can start. The resources histogram illustrates that the project team are split into three teams mainly Project Management, Development, and Quality team. They are required to perform between specific times to complete a task assigned to the team which explains the shift in the required hours each month. The Project Management Team required to perform 8 hours a day which will accumulate to 185 hours per month within the one to two months and nine to ten months of JIT Project. The job of Project Management is to guide the other teams on the tasks assigned to them.</p>
<p>            The Project Development Team is required to perform 8 hours a day and 185 hours per month within the three months to eight months of JIT Project Development since within this time they are the one developing the JIT Project. After the required months the required hours will begin to lessen. The Quality Management team has the most inconsistent required of hours because they need an output first before performing their task. In the first three months of the JIT Project they don’t have any hours of required at all since they do not have any work assigned to them yet. After three months, they are required to perform at least four to five hours of time. During the last two months, the required time begins to increase.</p>

<h2>Training:</h2>
<p>There is no training schedule with regards to the JIT Project since the Project Management outsource staff has the required skills sets. However, if training requirements are identified, funding will be provided from the project reserve.</p>
<h2>Performance Reviews:  </h2>
<p>Before releasing project resources, the project manager will review other team leader’s evaluation report of their member’s assigned work activities at the onset of the project and communicate all expectations of work to be performed. The project manager will then evaluate the performance of each team member throughout the project to see how effectively they are completing their assigned work.</p>

<h2>Procurement Constraints</h2>
<p>
	<strong>
		Schedule:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		Project schedule of procurement activities, contract administration, and contract fulfillment is must be established in the JIT Project Management. Any request of changes with these activities must go through the process of change control.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		If any risk occurred, it must be mitigate as soon as possible using the mitigation plan created for the procurement. Any request of change schedule and budget must go through the process of JIT Project Schedule Management.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Cost:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		Project budget has contingency and management reserves built in; however, these reserves may not be applied to procurement activities. Reserves are only to be used in the event of an approved change in project scope or at management&rsquo;s discretion.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Since the procured services can be procured at the close out of the JIT Project Management, specifically the turn-over of the Website. If there is any delay occurred, it can be ignored and change the schedule.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Scope:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		All the procured services must be justified to what cause would the JIT Project to have gain in said services. All the procurement activities must comply to the JIT Project scope such as the target budget, efficiency of the Website, etc., if there are any activities that does not relate to the project scope will be identified as out of scope.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Resources:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		All procured services are within the planned budget therefore must be perform and manage by the project manager accordingly to the plan. There will be no additional personnel to manage the activities nor re-allocated to support the procurement activities on this project.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Technology:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		The services have already been identified by the project team and will be included in the statemen of work as part of the RFP. While the vendor&rsquo;s&rsquo; proposal may include suggestion or alternative to the procured services but must keep in mind that it will be same service in the statement of work.
	</ul>

<h2>Decision Criteria</h2>
<p>
	The criteria for the selection and award of procurement contracts under this project will be based on the following decision criteria:
</p>
<ul>
	<ul>
		Vendor&rsquo;s Customer Support
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Performance
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Quality
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Cost
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Comparison of outsourced cost versus in-sourcing
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Past performance
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	These criteria will be measured by the Project Manager. The ultimate decision will be made based on these criteria as well as available resources.
</p>

<h2>Vendor Management</h2>
<p>
	The Project Manager is responsible for searching for the vendors as well as managing them. The Project Manager and the vendor will meet weekly with the contract and each vendor will discuss the services they offer and status. The meeting can be in person or by telecommunications. The purpose of the meetings to have an agreement between the vendor and the project manager because the project manager will inspect the service whether is good or not. This also will give the project manager whether the service is capable enough to comply with the project requirements establish in the project objectives. It also serves as an opportunity to ask questions. The project manager will be responsible for scheduling this meeting until the end of the contract.
</p>
<h2>Performance Metrics for Procurement Activities</h2>
<p>
	While the Subscribing and contracts department has their own internal metrics for procurement, the following metrics are established for vendor performance for this project&rsquo;s procurement activities. Each metric is rated on a 1-3 scale as indicated below:
</p>
<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">

=Risk Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            The JIT Project Management anticipated that risk and uncertainty of event that comes along with developing new and unique project. That said, the JIT Project Management takes advantage of the anticipated results by creating Risk Management Plan. The purpose of the Risk Management Plan is to establish the framework in which the JIT Project team will identify risk and developing strategies to counter act or avoid those risk. However, before risk can be identified and managed, there are preliminary project elements which must be completed. These elements are outlined in the risk management approach.</p>
<p>This project is considered a high-risk project as its function is to be the main transaction for the company of MC Manabat. The project’s function involves money transaction and confidential information transfer between the process of the JIT Project’s website, so the security of the website must be tested and check regularly to avoid implications within the business.</p>
<p>Before risk management begins it is imperative that a foundation is established for providing structured project information, thus, the following project elements were completed and defined prior to developing this Risk Management Plan:</p>
<ul>
	<ul><strong>Scope, Schedule, and Cost Management Plan must first be established to include:</strong></ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>Estimation of JIT Project cost and finalization of budget.</ul>
		<ul>Established Performance Metric System</ul>
		<ul>Identify the Work Modules of the JIT Project</ul>
		<ul>Identify the available Resources for the Project.</ul>
		<ul>Established a Work Schedule relative to the Work Modules.</ul>
		<ul>Developer Project WBS/WBS Dictionary.</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul><strong>Define the scope and limitation of the following:</strong></ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>Schedule Management Plan</ul>
		<ul>Cost Management Plan</ul>
		<ul>Quality Management Plan</ul>
		<ul>Stakeholder Management Plan</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<ul><strong>Define Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities</strong></ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>Project Manager chairs the risk assessment meetings</ul>
		<ul>Project team participates in risk assessment meetings and members serve as meeting recorder and timekeeper</ul>
		<ul>Key stakeholders participate in risk assessment meetings</ul>

<h2>Top Three Risks</h2>
<p>The top three high probability and high impact risks to The JIT Project are:</p>
<p><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></p>
<p>Due to the Internet of things gradually growing more of the securities are breach and it is important to the JIT Project especially dealing with money transaction to prevent or create a mitigation plan when event happens. The project manager will ensure that the risk of prevent or mitigate authorized person to hi-jack or acquire confidential information in the JIT Project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Time Management</strong></p>
<p>Due to the uncertainty of event that the Project Management assumes that will happen throughout the Project that will result in delaying of the project schedule as well as wasting resources for the JIT Project requires a plan of action of the process that will happen in case a problem event occurs. The Project Manager will mitigate the risk for the problems that will happen in the future and will have a back-up plan a ready.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Consistency of the Project </strong></p>
<p>Due to ineffective methodology and practice can lead the Project Management to have a risk in the Consistency of the project that will result in unintentional change of plans in the Project that will lead a dissatisfaction and disappointment of the Project Stakeholders and Client of the project. The project manager will mitigate the risk and it will require the members to adjust so that the Project Management will use as the standard practice.</p>
<h2>Risk Management Approach</h2>
<p>            The risk analysis regarding information systems that JIT Project Management have taken approach to manage risk for this project which the Project Management identified and ranked the various risks. The Project Team prioritize the highest impact risk were added to project schedule to ensure that the risk would minimize its probability of becoming a problem as well as taking the necessary precaution to implement the mitigation response plan at the appropriate time. Team leaders assigned in the risk management will inform status updates on their assigned risks and must be updated weekly by having the meetings with the project manager, but only when the meetings include their risk’s planned timeframe. Before the completion of the project, during closing process, the project manager will analyze the risk as well as the process to it. Based on the analysis, the project manager will identify any improvements that can be added to the risk management process for the Project Client to know as part of the maintenance of the website after the turnover has happened.</p>
<h2><strong>Risk Identification</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>            For the JIT Project, risk analysis method used by the Project team to identify risk is Qualitative Risk Analysis. The risk assessment meeting representatives discuss and create scenarios that outline the potential threats to the business and rank these threats according to the severity of the potential problems if it occurred. The procedure writing scenarios for the major risk, estimating the effects of event, if it happened, and creating a counter measures and safeguards against the event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Simulation Test</strong></p>
<p>One Security Analyst (SA) is involved in the project. The SA will simulate cyber-attack against the JIT Project to test the website whether the penetration of the SA will be successful, or the website would safely be unaffected by the attack. The result will be documented, and the JIT Project will be improved based on the comments and suggestion of the SA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reserve Funds</strong></p>
<p>A risk assessment meeting discussing allocating resources for uncertainty of events and must be only used when occurrence of the problem arises in the project management.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Daily Team Meeting</strong></p>
<p>Each team leader must discuss the status of their members about work assigned to them, what are the issues that they encounter, what solutions they need to work on, and what they will do for the day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risk Assessment Meeting</strong></p>
<p>A risk assessment meeting was held with key team leaders and stakeholders. The risks identified during this meeting were added to the project plan and Risk Table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Historical Review of Similar Projects</strong></p>
<p>The project team reviewed the history of similar projects to determine the most common risks and the strategies used to mitigate those risks.</p>

<h2>Risk Qualification and Prioritization</h2>
<p>            To determine the severity of the risk that will be identified by the team, a probability and impact was used as metric to the assigned risk. This process allowed the team leaders and project manager to prioritize risk based on the severity of the effect that the risk would have on the project. The project manager utilized a probability-impact matric to manage the team leader in moving each risk to the appropriate place on the table. Once the risks were assigned a probability and impact and placed in the appropriate position on the table, documenting the finished website and the project manager moved the process on to the next step: risk mitigation/avoidance planning.</p>
<h2>Risk Monitoring</h2>
<p>            The project schedules an assigned team member for each risk. During the daily meeting between leaders and members is assigned for each risk. The meeting will discuss the status of their work and as well as the risk associated to it. There will be a discussion of risk if the team member is assigned to do the work module with risk probability to it. Risk monitoring will be a continuous process throughout the life of the JIT Project. As risk approach on the JIT project the project manager will check the team leader’s status report of risk management of their members as well as the leaders with necessary status updates which include the risk status, identification of trigger conditions, and the documentation of the risk response.</p>
<h2>Risk Mitigation and Avoidance</h2>
<p>            The project manager ensures to aid team leader in developing and improving responses to each identified risk. As more risk are identified, if the risk is qualified based on the metric established, the team has to respond to develop avoidance and mitigation strategies to the risk. The identified risk will be also added to the risk register or in the table and the project plan to ensure that they are monitored when the work involves those risk.</p>
<p>            The risk for the JIT Project will be managed and controlled within the constraints of schedule, authority, and budget cost. All identified risk will be analyzed to determine how the risk will impact the time, scope, cost. The project manager with the assistance of the project team experts will determine the efficient way to deal with each risk to ensure that everything goes according to plan. There will be cases that it will be necessary to allow the project to extend its budget cost. If only necessary to allow the JIT Project for more resources to meet the deadline and requirements of the JIT project.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Register</strong></p>
<p>            The Risk Register is a log or list of all identified risk of the JIT Project. The list consists of risk description of their probability and impact, the category they belong to, mitigation strategy, and what event would trigger them. The risk register was identified in the project management meeting led by the project manager. During this meeting, the project team identified that there is a need of creating a risk management plan that the project team categorized each risk. In addition, the team assigned each risk will prioritize according to the probability and impact of the risk it could potentially have. The risk register also describes the mitigation strategy on each risk.</p>
<p>The identified risk in the risk register, each risk has been classified and added to the project plan. When the work module contains a risk—prior to when the risk is going to occur—the project manager will assign a leader to ensure adherence to the agreed mitigation strategy. Each assigned leader will provide the status of the risk relevant to their group in their daily project meeting.</p>

=Communication Management Plan=

<h2>Introductions</h2>
<p>The reason of creating a Communications Management Plan is for the project team to determine what are the communication requirements for the project and how information will be delivered. Communications Management Plan will be the one setting the scheme for the communications of the project, it will serve as a guide for the project team members throughout the duration of the project and it will only be changed or updated when needed. It also determines and describe the roles of persons involved in the project.</p>
<h2>Communication Management Approach</h2>
<p>The project manager will be the one responsible in ensuring effective communications on this project. The project manager will be allocating most of his time looking out for the project and reporting the performance of the project to the project team members and stakeholders, he will also be responsible organizing meeting, creating the project plan, constructing and reading emails, meeting with his project team members and managing the work being performed by them.</p>
<p>By having a good communication management approach a lot of project management problems can be prevented.</p>
<h2>Communication Management Constraints</h2>
<p>            Every project is no exception to limitation and constraints because they must be within the scope of the project and comply with its budget, scheduling and resource necessity. So the project planning and documentation is also limited and constrained. There must be an administrative or organizational policy requirements that must be followed as part of communications management and these constraints must be clearly discussed to all the project stakeholders and make sure that all of them have understood.</p>
<p>            All activities in the project communication will appear within the project’s approved budget, schedule and resource allocations. The one who will be responsible in ensuring that all communication activities are performed by the project team without external resources that may affect the budget and exceed the authorized budget is the project manager.</p>
