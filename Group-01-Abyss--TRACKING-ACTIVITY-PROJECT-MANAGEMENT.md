=Company Profile=
<p><strong>Brief Background:</strong></p>
<p>M.C. Manabat is a sole proprietorship business that mainly sells computer, computer peripherals, and Software. Currently the client only does things manually and they use mobile phones when receiving orders from the customers and ordering to the supplier.</p>
<p>The business wants to adopts the J.I.T(Just-In-Time) approach because J.I.T (Just-In-Time) inventory system has several advantages like production runs remain short, reduces costs and eliminates warehouse storage needs, companies also spend less money on raw materials because they buy just enough to make the products and no more, just like the J.I.T ordering system they will only order the item from the supplier when the customer orders the item, reducing cost and eliminating warehouse storage needs.</p>

=Business Case=
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The M.C Manabat is a retail business that sells monitors, telephones, televisions etc. by sending out business proposal to different offices and companies. The problem in the business is that their sales and services are in poor condition due to the fact that M.C Manabat&rsquo;s business still uses phone to negotiate and inquiring the customers about the item&rsquo;s availability which obviously takes a lot of time because there are tons of types and branding for each product that it may take a while for the customer to choose, lastly M.C Manabat wanted to sell his products to individuals to widen their market range and possibly increase their sales, taking all those information into account, the project team came up with the conclusion to create a website that enables the customer to navigate and view&nbsp; product information by also doing a website that is publicly available to all people who access the site with that being said the project team assumes that M.C Manabat would gain new kinds of customer and will increase their sales.</p>

<h2>Issue</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current issue of the business that the proposed project will address is the lack of visibility for the Customer to view the products that M.C Manabat sells and most of the time the misunderstanding between M.C Manabat and the Supplier and also between M.C Manabat and the Customer because they communicate using mobile phones or telephones.</p>
<h2>Anticipated Outcomes</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anticipated outcome of this proposed project if it is successfully implemented is that it would increase the sale of the business by widening its market range because the products of M.C Manabat would be available online, this project will also help the business have its own platform wherein the M.C Manabat, the supplier and the customer can communicate.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project team members have proposed different options and alternatives in finding the best way to improve the business processes and eliminate the costs of the manual processes that are still being done in the business. The project team have concluded that the best way to improve the technology and the performance of the business is to have a website because having a website would widen the market range of M.C Manabat&rsquo;s product and help the business have its own platform wherein they can communicate with their suppliers and customers. </p>

<h2>Justification</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The implementation of the JIT E-commerce Website would reduce if not eliminate the manual business processes currently done in the business, it could also possibly help the business increase their sales by making their products available online and making their products available online widens the market range of their products and possibly increasing their sales.</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The business encountered many problems for manually doing things and not having an E-commerce site such as misunderstanding between M.C Manabat and the customer and also M.C Manabat and the supplier. This misunderstanding consumes a lot of time leading to unorganized business. There are also some instances that can interrupt mobile conversation so the client does not want to rely on mobile phones.</p>

<h2>Organizational Impact</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The implementation of the project would greatly impact the organization because it would change the current manual business process which are M.C Manabat sending out business proposals to different companies and communicating with his customers and suppliers through mobile phones or telephones because if the project is successfully implemented M.C Manabat would no longer have to send out business proposal to different companies because his products are now available online and also he doesn&rsquo;t need to communicate with his customers and supplier using mobile phones or telephone because he already have a system wher</p>
<h2>Technology Migration</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project team will be reducing if not eliminating the current manual processes of the business which is the communication with the customers, suppliers and logistics by using cloud technology. The effects of the cloud technology to the business is provide a better customer-relationship as well improving the turn-around time and efficiency of the business processes since the legacy technology have no virtual data records and only uses ledger as their way of recording data so the company would have to manually write their records on the website. The company is required to subscribe to a cloud technology in order to be used and one of the project management is to minimize the cost of the project.</p>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project team will create an E-commerce site to address the business problems which are no item visibility for the customer to view the items that M.C Manabat is selling, no permanent location wherein the customer, the supplier and M.C Manabat can communicate and communicating using mobile phones and telephones is prone to misunderstanding and the customer doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to track the items that he/she ordered. By having an E-commerce site M.C Manabat will have the capability to display his products online and also this creates a platform wherein he can communicate with his customers and suppliers lastly the E-commerce site also comes with a tracker wherein the customer will be given a transaction number once he /she successfully purchased a product then he/she will just have to input the given transaction number in the tracker tab to allow him/her to know where his/her ordered item is.</p>

<h2>Goals and Objectives</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project should be innovative and effective than the current business process of M.C Manabat Company.</p>

After the meeting the project management should come up with an analysis for the project based on the information gathered in the meeting this includes the cost of the project, the technology will be used, and coming up with a plan to satisfy the stakeholders as well as the product owner. Then the project management schedule a meeting with the client with the development team for them to decide the designs of the project. In the meeting both parties should be able to create backlogs that they upon agreed on working. Then after the design they should start implementing the project itself but having the waterfall methodology approach is risky and prone to failure, in response to that the project management and the product owner should schedule a sprint to iterate the analysis and designs of the project and report it to the product owner and give a feedback to achieve a better output and results.</p>

The project would significantly have affected all departments of the company due to automation that the project would implement. The departments in the company serves as the main function of the business however their roles and responsibilities are already deprecated that their functionality generates a lot of cost and the project management team desired to address a solution to the issue.</p>

The Marketing &amp; Sales could affect greatly to the profit of the company since knowing that their supply is enough will greatly reduce their inventory cost in the company. The Marketing &amp; Sales involvement in the project is highly monitored since the team is developing an E-Commerce Website that include what items should they inputted in the website and Marketing &amp; Sales Analytics that would accurately analyse the trend in the Market. They influence the project from modules that would support their roles that would be the advertisement and marketing sales analytics module after those modules are implemented, monitored, and reviewed their influence in the project would gradually decline throughout the project.</p>
<p>            Accounting &amp; Finance perform in the company as the department that hold the transaction that has been formed in the company. They also monitor the budgeting and the flow of the profits of the company. The Accounting &amp; Finance is focused on the assets of the company, calculate their profits, deciding out of it, Marketing &amp; Sales heavily relies on this department since profits can greatly influence decisions of the sales decision. The Accounting &amp; Finance will impact on the project since one of the project modules is to automate the transactions that will the company made in the Website. To greatly increase their work accuracy and efficiency the website would automate the transactions of the company, this means that Accounting &amp; Finance will now rely on the System for the computing and transacting for the business communicating with this department on this module will greatly increase the succession of that project module.</p>
<p>            The Inventory &amp; Logistics will heavily rely on the Marketing &amp; Sales by cause of they need the item readily available in their inventory being the inventory department doesn’t really mean that they’re the one purchasing the products from the distributor that’s the duty of the Marketing &amp; Sales collaborating with Accounting &amp; Finance. Their interest in the project is the item availability and stock, they are the one handling the delivery to the client after the transaction that has been completed. Accounting &amp; Finance influence the project on how the system would notify them if the delivery has arrived, the delivery has no defects, the delivery has all the requirements assess then they also cover the delivery address of the client, and how they can deliver it to the client. In that said they’re the final phase of the transaction.</p>
<p>Although, the last stakeholders play the role as external to the company but they also a key function of the company business. The Distributors of Information Technology Innovative Products as the name suggested they’re the distributors of the company. They don’t hold any interest other than purchasing their products but in the company of our client suggested to be also automated by purchasing then orders to them directly by the system however the order would name to the company not the name of the customer who requested the order. This external rely on the Accounting &amp; Finance since the only impact of this department is transaction to them of the order requested by the company’s customer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To assist with stakeholder identification and analysis, the team has created and is completing a Stakeholder Analysis Register categorized by Stakeholder Group. The Stakeholder Analysis Register captures the following information</p>
<ul>
	<li>Group name</li>
	<li>Number of Stakeholders in the Group</li>
	<li>Description of the Group</li>
	<li>Level of Impact on the Project</li>
	<li>Level the Group is Impacted by Project</li>
	<li>Current Change Readiness State</li>
	<li>Desired Change Readiness State</li>
	<li>Issues, Opportunities and Risks associated with each group</li>
	<li>Strategies and Actions to address issues, risks and opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>A snapshot from the Stakeholder Analysis Register is provided below.</p>
<p>Please note: Impact is measured by High (H), Medium (M) or Low (L).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>State of change readiness is assessed the measures as follows:</p>
<p>U – Unaware – this group has no information about the project</p>
<p>R – Resistant – aware of project and resistant to the changes and impacts the project may bring</p>
<p>N – Neutral – aware of the project and neither supportive nor resistant</p>
<p>S – Supportive – aware of the project and the potential changes and impacts and is supportive</p>
<p>L – Leading – aware of the project and actively engaged to ensure the project’s success</p>

<h2>Power/Interest Classification</h2>
<p>            As mentioned above, the Just-In-Time project is assessing each group’s position, as well as their impact on the project and/or how they are impacted by the project.  One purpose of this activity is to help identify and categorize groups so that appropriate attention can be given to each group according to the level of engagement needed.  To help in this process, the project will use the PMBOK Power/Interest Grid to categorize each stakeholder group.  The Power/Interest Grid analyses stakeholder groups in a visual manner to further establish stakeholders’ level of interest or concern and their ability to influence the project outcomes.</p>
<p>An important outcome of the stakeholder identification and analysis work, including the Power/Interest Grid, is to identify the most influential and most impacted stakeholder groups so that a focused stakeholder management strategy and plan can be developed and executed.</p>
<p>Provided below is an example Power/Interest Grid with A-H representing generic stakeholders.  The results of the Power/Interest Grid will be added to the Stakeholder Analysis Register document.</p>
<p>Alternative to the power/interest grid that could be considered such as the power/influence and influence/impact grid for the reasons the system is integrating into these departments in that said their influence and concerns shall be considered.</p>
<h2><em></em>Stakeholder Interviews</h2>
<p>To confirm the Stakeholder Identification and Analysis process is accurate and complete, the project team, led by the Project Manager, will help facilitate a series of reviews with the Department and others.  In addition, optional qualitative interviews may be performed for the Stakeholder Groups identified as most influential or most impacted by the project to validate that their issues and concerns have been captured accurately.</p>

<h2>Plan Stakeholder Management</h2>
<p>Based upon the information gathered in the Stakeholder Analysis Register and Communication Plan, the Project Manager will be responsible for engaging stakeholders throughout the lifecycle of the project.  The level of engagement required for each stakeholder may vary over the course of the project.  For example, during the beginning stages of the project, it might be necessary for the Project Manager to engage key stakeholders to be highly engaged.  Highly engaged key stakeholders in the early stages of the project are pivotal for project kick-off, achieving staff buy-in and clearing obstacles.  As the project progresses, the level of engagement will shift from key stakeholders to the broader project team and end-users. </p>
<h2>Stakeholder Engagement</h2>
<p>To ensure the correct level of engagement is being achieved by each stakeholder, the Project Manager will analyse current levels of engagement by using the PMBOK Stakeholders Engagement Assessment Matrix.  As noted above in the Stakeholder Analysis Register, each stakeholder group shall be assessed in terms of their current and desired level of engagement.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix.  </strong>List stakeholders and place a “C” for their current level of engagement and “D” in the column of their desired level of engagement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            The project team is in the process of identifying and assessing the stakeholders on how they can influence changes in the project, what would be the limitations of their influence, and how the project team would manage the changes basically Anticipating Business Process changes will be the key in this analysis. The project team considered each stakeholder’s power and interest. The project team expecting to raise concerns based on their involvement in the project meaning the modules that will going to affect the departments current culture the company. The project team currently assessing the stakeholder’s willingness to change since the system would automate most of their work minimizing the amount of work load although it’s been reduced it doesn’t mean that they’ll be losing job but their work would transition to creating information to be monitoring the information generated by system. The appropriate method of communication to project team to company is scheduling a meeting with the owner of the business due to the fact that we unable to identify the specific person in the department to discuss with. The project team is still verge on assessing their readiness to change in the company. The client would rely the feedback from the department and in the meeting, we would discuss the concerns of the departments and generate a conclusion out of it then the client would rely again the message to the departments, to not waste time to these meeting suggesting of accompanying the client in the meetings would be more efficient.</p>

<h2>Manage Stakeholder Engagement</h2>
<p>            To effectively manage stakeholder engagement, the Just-In-Time Project will utilize the Communication Plan and strategies identified above to communicate project related information to key stakeholders in a proactive and timely manner.  Leveraging the information provided in the Communication Plan (i.e., stakeholder groups, communication items, purpose, method of communication, and frequency), the project will have the ability to increase support and minimize stakeholder resistance throughout the life of the project.  Managing stakeholder engagement helps to increase the probability of project success by ensuring that stakeholders clearly understand the project goals, objectives, benefits, and risks.</p>
<p>In line with the analysis above, the project team will also be actively listening and soliciting input and feedback to make sure communications are being received and understood, and to capture important information to help make adjustments and to respond to problem areas.</p>
<p>Other project artefacts will factor into Stakeholder Management as well, including the list of Business Process Changes and the Change Control process, both of which consider the impact on stakeholders.  The project Issues Log is another tool to collect, document, and address concerns raised by stakeholders and stakeholder management risks that have materialized into issues that must be managed.</p>
<p>Product backlog in the sprint will factor into Stakeholder Management as well, which consider whether the business requirements of the stakeholders are assessed by the development team. Testing the system will affect since the project team uses Agile Methodology so iterating the whole project is common in the team that includes in other areas as well, after the testing the stakeholders are expected to raise a concern regarding the system. If the stakeholders requested for a change in scope they are required to submit it to the project team’s adviser that would decide whether to reject the idea or integrate it into the project.</p>
<h2>Monitor Stakeholder Engagement</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the Communications Plan and the Risk Management Plan, the Just-In-Time Project will have mechanisms to receive ongoing direct feedback from key stakeholders, including conducting a Survey Testing of the Website, Annual Meeting, and Survey Questions. Individual stakeholders will be encouraged to participate and to voice questions and concerns, with the most serious issues and concerns that are raised addressed in a formal, rigorous process through the Issues and Risk logs.</p>
<p>As described in the Scope Management Plan, the project will solicit broad participation in the collection and validation of requirements, which will uncover issues and concerns early on so they can be addressed.</p>
<p>Stakeholders are critical to the project’s success.  The project team has planned for and will work to involve, engage and listen to all key stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
<h2>Stakeholder Plan Updates</h2>
<p>Note that the Stakeholder Management Plan and associated documents are not static.  The stakeholders identified and their information documented in the Stakeholder Analysis Register will be reviewed at least once a month to ensure the plan is meeting project expectations and to make modifications if required</p>


=Scope Management Plan=


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Scope Management Plan provides the process of gathering the objective requirements, Defining the scope of the project, Verifying the scope of the project, Controlling measures and verifications and the project's work breakdown structure. This plan of documents also pertains to the roles and responsibilities as they required in the project scope. Any project communication which relates to the project's scope should adhere to Scope Management Plan.</p>
<p>This project is for gathering, analyzing, and designing a new concept to the business which will be used to reduce the current issues in the business such as reducing the cost of the warehouse, transaction or communications, and digital transformation. No programming nor system output to be anticipated for this project.</p>
<h2>Scope Management Approach</h2>
<p>The project manager is the sole responsible for the project's scope management. The scope of the project is defined in the Scope statement, work breakdown structure(WBS) and WBS dictionary. The project manager will establish measured project scope and the documentation of it that will based on the project's sponsor and stakeholders vision in the project which includes the requirements, quality checklist and work performance measurement. Proposed scope may change over time and initiated by the project manager, stakeholder or any member of the project team. All the change request must be submitted and discuss by the project team. The project team requires to consult the changes to the stakeholder to measure the effectivity of the change and accept the changes to the project. Upon the approval of the changes, the project team requires to also update all the documents that impacted the changes and communicate the scope change to all stakeholders. Based on the information gathered and inputted by the project manager and stakeholders, the project sponsor is the responsible for the final acceptance of the project deliverables and the project scope.</p>
<h2>Roles and Responsibilities </h2>
<p>The project manager, sponsor and the project team will play an important role in analyzation and documentation the scope of the project. As such, the project sponsor, manager and the team must be assigned to their respective roles and knows the responsibilities to ensure that the person assigned is performing the work better than the expected throughout the entire duration of the project.</p>

<h2> Scope Definition </h2>
<p>The extension for the project was characterized through far-reaching comprehensive analysis, requirements, and gathering process. Initial, a meeting was held to gather the information regarding in the organization's business operations and status then an intensive examination was performed on the organization's business process considering representative. From this data, the venture group built up the task necessities documentation, the prerequisites administration design, and the necessities attributable network for what the new programming application must achieve but necessarily building it.</p>
<p>The undertaking portrayal and expectations were created considering the prerequisites gathering procedure and contribution from topic specialists in programming and business applications. This procedure of judgment gave criticism on the best approaches to meet the first prerequisites of giving another product stage from which the organization can enhance its cost-benefit following and inside money related procedures.</p>
<h2> Project Scope Statement </h2>
<ul>
	<li>The Just-In-Time Website overall includes the design, functionality, and testing of the project for an E-Commerce Website. Additionality, will automate the transaction between the Customer to Distributor, and Distributor to Logistics. the payment gateway will be required to be implemented for the transaction to materialized into data entry while all the operations is processing in the background the effects of the automation of the transaction leads to reducing of inventory cost of the company.</li>
	<li>The Just-In-Time Website will also include Analytics for the Marketing and Sales of the company to provide better business decisions in the company. Due to the time constraint of three months of planning, analysis, and development the project is forced to reduce the amount of work per sprint.</li>
	<li>The project team and client agreed upon on the requirements of the website to be at the prototype stage with the agreed modules implement to the website which are the automation and the sales report analytics as well as the common functionality of an E-Commerce Website which are Shopping Cart, User Authentication, and Order Item. Better Designs can be implemented in other iteration of the project.</li>
	<li>This project does not include ongoing operations and maintenance cost of the website since the development team can benefit from the student development tools sponsored by their respective colleges.</li>
	<li>Bank-to-Bank method of payment gateway the project team and client agreed to avoid the work since the module requires the project team to apply credit cards transaction.</li>
	<li>The project is not to exceed 180 days in duration, on the days of development will only use development tools, Environment, and equipment available to us. Assumptions for this project are that support will be provided by the project client, adviser, and all department managers and that information, data, as well as adequate resources are available for the successful completion of this project.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Work Breakdown Structure </h2>
<p>For the succession of the project the management are required to work together but to be effective the project must work subdivided into individual work bundles not to surpass 20 hours of work. This will enable the Project Manager to more successfully deal with the venture's degree as the undertaking group takes a shot at the assignments important for venture culmination. The undertaking is separated into three stages: the outline stage, the Analyzing stage, and the Designing stage. Every one of these stages is then subdivided additionally down to work bundles that are assessed to require close to 20 hours of work and no under 2 hours of work.</p>
<h2> Scope Verification </h2>
<p>As the Project progress, the Project Advisor will verify the scopes and project deliverables compared to the original scope as defined in the scope statement, WBS, and WBS Dictionary. Once the client verifies the scope of the project satisfies the requirements defined in the project plan, the Project Advisor and Client will communicate for formal acknowledgment of the deliverable. Amid this gathering the Project Advisor will exhibit the deliverable to the Project Client for formal acknowledgment. The Project Client will acknowledge the deliverable by marking an undertaking deliverable acknowledgment archive. This will guarantee that venture work stays inside the extent of the task on a predictable premise for the duration of the life of the undertaking. An example of how the project adviser, client, and manager will verify the deliverables are drawn below:</p>

<h2> Scope Control </h2>
<p>The Project adviser and the project team will discuss and identify on controlling the scope of the project. The project team will have based the statement of the work using WBS Dictionary and Product Backlogs for each Scope. The project team will guarantee that they execute the job based on the description of the WBS Dictionary and generate the defined deliverable for each WBS element. The project advisor will monitor the project team and their progression the project to provide guidance that the scope control process is followed and progress is reported through the Project Scope measurement tools.</p>

<h2> Scope Change </h2>
<p>If an issue is arising in the project that needs a drastic change in the project scope requesting a change is the best course action. The process for recommending and estimating the change to the scope of the project are cautiously must executed. Any project team member, or project client can request changes to the project scope. All change request must be submitted to the project advisor in the form of a project change request document. The project advisor will then analyze the suggested change to the scope of the project. The project advisor will then either reject the change request if it does not in line with the purpose of the project, or convene a Change Control meeting between the project team and client to review the change request further and perform an impact assessment of the change. If the change request receives initial approval by the project advisor and client, the project manager will communicate the scope change to all project team members then they will update all the necessary documents, deliverables, and product backlogs.</p>


=Cost Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            The person who will be fully responsible for managing the costs is the Project Manager since he is in charge of the project. During the duration of the project a meeting will be held every two weeks wherein the team will meet the client and present and evaluate the project’s cost performance for the previous weeks. Earned value will be used in measuring the performance of the project. The Project Manager will also be responsible for accounting for cost deviations and presenting it to the Client with options to bring the project back on track or budget. The Client will have the power to adjust the project to try to bring it back within the budget.</p>
<h2>Cost Management Approach</h2>
<p>            The cost for this project will be managed at a certain level in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). At this level Control Accounts (CA) will be created to track costs. The financial performance of the project will be determined and guided by Earned Value calculations for the CA’s.</p>
<p>            The status of the cost to cautionary will be changed by the cost variances of +/- 0.1 in the cost and schedule performances indexes; also, those values will be changed to yellow in the project status reports. The status of the cost to an alert stage will be changed by cost variances of +/- 0.2 in the cost and schedule performance indexes; those values will be changed to red in the project status reports. Having those values changed to red will require the Project Manager to do some corrective action in order to bring the cost and/or schedule performance indexes below the alert level, but the corrective actions will require a project change request and must be approved by the Project Sponsor before it can become part of the project.     </p>

<h2>Measuring Project Costs</h2>
<p>            The Earned Value Management will be used in evaluating the performance of the Project. The following Earned Value metrics that will be used to evaluate the project’s cost performance are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Schedule Variance (SV)</li>
	<li>Cost Variance (CV)</li>
	<li>Schedule Performance Index (SPI)</li>
	<li>Cost Performance Index (CPI)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Schedule Performance Index or Cost Performance Index has a variance of between 0.1 and 0.2 the Project Manager must report the reason for the exception. If the SPI or CPI has a variance of greater than 0.2 the Project Manager must report the reason for the exception and provide management a detailed corrective plan to bring the projects performance back to acceptable levels.</p>

<h2>Reporting Format</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>            Reporting for cost management will be included in the monthly project status report.  The Monthly Project Status Report will include a section labeled, “Cost Management”.  This section will contain the Earned Value Metrics identified in the previous section.  All cost variances outside of the thresholds identified in this Cost Management Plan will be reported on including any corrective actions which are planned.  Change Requests which are triggered based upon project cost overruns will be identified and tracked in this report.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Cost Variance Response Process</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>            The Control Thresholds for this project is a CPI or SPI of less than 0.8 or greater than 1.2.  If the project reaches one of these Control Thresholds a Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan is required.  The Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with options for corrective actions within five business days from when the cost variance is first reported.  Within three business days from when the Project Sponsor selects a corrective action option, the Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with a formal Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan.  The Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan will detail the actions necessary to bring the project back within budget and the means by which the effectiveness of the actions in the plan will be measured.  Upon acceptance of the Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan it will become a part of the project plan and the project will be updated to reflect the corrective actions.</p>
<h2>Cost Change Control Process</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>            The cost change control process will follow the established project change request process.  Approvals for project budget/cost changes must be approved by the project sponsor.</p>
<p><strong>Project Budget</strong></p>

=Schedule Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            The Schedule Management Plan is the process of structuring the strategies, systems, and documentation for planning, developing, overseeing, executing, and controlling the project’s schedule. The importance of this process that it provides instruction and knowledge on how the project’s schedule will be controlled throughout the whole project. The schedule management plan includes identifying methodologies and techniques, analyzing, controlling, limitations, prioritizing and distributing all time related changes in the schedule. </p>
<h2>Schedule Management Approach</h2>
<p>            In addition to Project Charter for the basis of the project schedule, the scope management plan is also a factor to be added as additional inputs. The inputs are evaluated then defined into activities that will determine as the module of the project which must be performed for the succession of the project. The activities will be arranged into order as work packages and assign each activity relationship between project activities. Each of the activities have duration which the project team requires to estimate and calculate the number of work periods required to complete the activities as whole package. To create the project schedule, the team will be using Microsoft Project on creating the Gantt Chart of the project schedule. To oversee the project’s growth estimating the assign resources to the work packages in order for the project to be complete the schedule development.</p>
<p>Once an initial schedule has been created, the project team and the resources assigned to it will work on it cautiously assigned to project work packages in order to avoid the project’s schedule to be in critical path. The project team and assets must consent to the proposed work package task, duration of the activities, and the project schedule. Once this accomplish the project adviser will check then authorized the schedule after that then it will be baselined.</p>
<p>The following be assigned as points of reference or milestones for the project schedule:</p>
<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">

<p>Once the schedule is baselined as a major aspect of progressive elaboration, defining activities later may uncover new extension that was not envisaged previously. This ought to be taken care of through formal change control. Thus, change ask for is added to the is procedure as additional outputs. At the point when such changes are joined the plans and baselines will experience updates. The same are reflected as additional outputs. The development approach will altogether impact planning approach, evaluating methods, devices and how the schedule is managed and controlled.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Schedule Control</h2>
<p>            In order for the project team to control the schedule throughout of the lifetime of the project, the project schedule will be monitored, reviewed and revised when necessary whether a new or old information is added, deleted or updated. The project team members who accomplished the task will also be presenting the completion percentages that will be discuss to the project team.</p>
<p>            The project manager is responsible in managing schedule updates, meetings, and report as well as identifying the tasks that are scheduled for necessary modifications. Suggesting a schedule change requests and informing project schedule status to the stakeholder are also project manager's responsibilities.</p>
<p>            The project team is required in participating for the scheduled updates and meetings of the project. The project team are required to collaborate to any changes of the schedule from start-to-finish dates to the project manager and project adviser; and participating in schedule variance resolution as needed. The project manager will keep the project client updated of the project schedule status and the project client will review/approve any schedule request submitted by the project manager.</p>
<h2>Schedule Changes and Thresholds</h2>
<p>            When the project schedule is created by the project team, it is necessary that the project sponsor sets a limit to organize the schedule parameters wherein the project is anticipated to be finished or operational, this is important because it is necessary to align the project client visions and expectations to the actual project. One of the factors that could affect the changes in schedule is poor schedule management which will require an extension or change of project schedule. If there are any circumstances that may possibly affect the schedule which exceeds the limits set by the project sponsor, the project manager should submit a schedule change request and it should be approved by the project sponsor before the schedule change is made.</p>
<p>            The project manager will set a meeting with the project team to analyze and assess the change if any of the project team member concluded that an adjustment to the schedule is essential and an adjustment to the schedule is crucial to the succession of the project plan, the project manager, project team, project adviser, and the client must have a scheduled assessment meeting regarding the schedule adjustments. The project manager and the project team must decide which tasks will be affected by the potential change. A potential change and any alternative solutions activities must have materialized to see how they would affect the scope, schedule, and resources. After the analysis is completed, the project manager must resolve if any change will surpass the original schedule as planned or will go according to the schedule, then a schedule change request must be submitted.</p>
<p>Submittal of a schedule change request to the project stakeholder for approval is required if the following conditions is true:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The recommended change is reducing the duration or deliverables of an individual Sprint Backlog in developing phase in the project, or increasing the duration of individual Sprint Backlog by 10% or more, to clarify adding it to the duration not extending the work over all duration.</li>
	<li>Changes in the scope statement shall be considered to prevent inconsistencies in the documentation phase of the project. The project team must compile all the inconsistencies in the document before increasing the work packages by 5% or more to update the changes in all of documentation.</li>
	<li>Another approach to the change is either to reduce the duration of the overall project schedule by 10% or more, or increase the duration of the overall project schedule by 2% or more.</li>
</ul>
<p>            Any change request that do not comply meet these thresholds are still viable to submission to the project manager for approval. Once the change request has been reviewed and analyze by the project manager consulting first with the project adviser is recommended then discussing it with the project client is a must. After approving the change request, the project manager is responsible of adjusting the schedule and updating all the change and effects to the project team and client. The project manager must also ensure that all change requests are archived in the project records repository.</p>
<h2>Scope Change</h2>
<p>            If an issue is arising in the project that needs a drastic change in the project scope requesting a change is the best course action. The process for recommending and estimating the change to the scope of the project are cautiously must executed. Any project team member, or project client can request changes to the project scope. All change request must be submitted to the project advisor in the form of a project change request document. The project advisor will then analyze the suggested change to the scope of the project. The project advisor will then either reject the change request if it does not in line with the purpose of the project, or convene a Change Control meeting between the project team and client to review the change request further and perform an impact assessment of the change. If the change request receives initial approval by the project advisor and client, the project manager will communicate the scope change to all project team members’ then they will update all the necessary documents, deliverables, and product backlogs.</p>

=Quality Management Plan=
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            The Quality Management Plan for the Just-In-Time Logistics E-Commerce Website (JIT) project will establish the activities, processes, and procedures for ensuring a quality product upon the conclusion of the project.  The Quality Management Plan documents the important procedures and information required to effectively execute the project quality assurance from project planning to execution of the project. It defines the project’s quality approaches, strategies, criteria for and territories of usage, and function and obligations.</p>
<p>            During the Planning Phase of the project, The Quality Management Plan is developed and is considered as a core component of the Project Management Plan especially in Execution Phase. Its target group is the project manager, project team, project client, stakeholder, and project adviser whose support is expected to ensure quality is planned, define how quality will be managed, define quality assurance and control activities, and lastly, define acceptable quality standards.</p>
<h2>Quality Management Approach</h2>
<p>            The quality management approach for the JIT project will ensure quality is planned for both the product and processes.  In order to be successful, this project will meet its quality objectives by utilizing an integrated quality approach to define quality standards, measure quality and continuously improve quality. Website quality for the JIT project will be defined by the company’s current standards and criteria for its reliability, performance, and functionality of the website.  The focus is on the project’s deliverable and the standards and criteria being used will ensure the product meets established quality standards and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>            Process quality for the JIT project will focus on the processes by which the project deliverable will be developed.  Establishing process quality standards will ensure that all activities conform to an organizational standard which results in the successful delivery of the website.</p>
<p>            The project team will work with the Quality Group to define and document all organizational and project specific quality standards for both product and processes.  All quality documentation will become part of the JIT Project Plan and will be transitioned to operations upon the successful completion of the project.</p>
<p>            Metrics will be established and used to measure quality throughout the project life cycle for the product and processes.  The Quality Group Manager will be responsible for working with the project team to define these metrics, conduct measurements, and analyze results.  These product and process measurements will be used as one criterion in determining the success of the project and must be reviewed by the project sponsor.  Metrics will include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Schedule</li>
	<li>Resources</li>
	<li>Cost</li>
	<li>Process performance</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Automation of the Purchase to Distributor</li>
		<li>Automation of the Process to Logistics</li>
		<li>Timeliness</li>
		<li>Financial Performance</li>
		<li>Resource Effectiveness</li>
		<li>Marketing Sales Analytics</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Product performance</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Operability</li>
		<li>Performability</li>
		<li>Presentability</li>
		<li>Reliability</li>
		<li>Usability</li>
		<li>Accessibility</li>
		<li>Efficiency</li>
		<li>Interoperability</li>
		<li>Maintainability</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Customer Satisfaction (as a result of field trials)</li>
</ul>
<p>Quality improvements will be identified by any member of the project team or quality group.  Each recommendation will be reviewed to determine the cost versus benefit of implementing the improvement and how the improvement will impact the product or processes.  If an improvement is implemented the project manager will update all project documentation to include the improvement and the quality manager will update the organizational documentation the improvement affects.</p>
<h2>Quality Requirements / Standards</h2>
<p>            The objective of this sector is to support an accurate and quantifiable definition of Quality for JIT project. This definition is expressed as far as general Quality Factors, particular framework arranged Quality Criteria to be estimated for each factor, and measured quality targets and Quality metrics.</p>
<p>            The Quality Factors, Quality Criteria and Quality Metrics must be discussed in detail, right from the beginning of the project life cycle. Preceding to developing each JIT project component, the Quality Factors and Criteria must be evaluated to determine their relevance. Those variables and criteria deemed important must be considered as critical success factors for the component.</p>
<p><strong><em>Quality Factors:</em></strong></p>
<p>            Quality Factors are the user-perceived aspects of the JIT project components that conclude if JIT project meets user prerequisites.</p>
<p>The Table below presents the fundamental quality factors of JIT project. The table recognizes and depicts each issue, and positions the most elevated factors of components that are the indispensable Success Factors of the project</p>
<p>Note that the most imperative Quality Factor for JIT Project is Operability. This is Don Miguel Manabat's essential factor for deciding the quality of JIT Project. All other quality factors are subordinate to this objective.</p>

<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>            The quality assurance of the JIT project focuses on the processes used in the Services of the JIT Website.  In order to ensure quality, an iterative quality process will be used throughout the project life cycle.  This iterative process includes measuring process metrics, analyzing process data, and continuously improving the processes. </p>

<p>The quality manager will provide per module quality management and create a test plan per module on a weekly basis, monitor process performance metrics, and assure all processes comply with project and organizational standards.  If discrepancies are found, the quality manager will meet with the Project Manager and review the identified discrepancies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Project Manager will schedule regularly occurring project, management, and document reviews.  In these reviews, an agenda item will include a review of project processes, any discrepancies and/or audit findings from the quality manager, and a discussion on process improvement initiatives. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Process improvement is another aspect of quality assurance.  Quality assurance reviews, findings, and assessments should always result in some form of process improvement and, as a result, product improvement.  All process improvement efforts must be documented, implemented, and communicated to all stakeholders as changes are made.</p>
<h2>Quality Control</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>            The quality control of the JIT project focuses primarily on the JIT project and the acceptable standards and performance.  The quality performance standards for the JIT project are in accordance with the organizational standards of performance of a website.  However, there are several project-specific quality standards which were established specifically for the JIT project. The suggested innovation to the JIT project will be submitted to the quality management which will be analyzed and tested whether the modules meet the requirements of the expected performance. Additionally, all test cases will be conducted on each module to ensure compliance with established quality standards.  The table below illustrates all the quality criteria for the JIT Project:</p>

=Human Resource Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            Human resources management is a plan for JIT Project that guides the project team assigning roles and responsibilities of the team member in human resources activities stated in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) which covers the start until the closure of the project. The human resource management plan includes:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
	<li>Roles and Responsibilities of the team member whether the members are tasked in quality, documents, development, etc.</li>
	<li>Project Organization Charts that visualizes the activities and the member assigned to the activity that also measures the allotted time in the activity.</li>
	<li>Staffing management plan should state:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>What type of staff should be included in the project?</li>
	<li>Training requirements in the project</li>
	<li>Timeline for resources/skill sets</li>
	<li>How performance should be evaluated?</li>
	<li>What types of motivation should be used?</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>The purpose of the human resource management plan is to determine which of the methods of staffing in a website development project should be aligned with the project objectives. This includes appropriate human resources with skill sets that are required in the project if any gaps in skills such as collaborating, or communications are identified, team building strategies are clearly defined and team activities are effectively managed.</p>
<h2><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong></h2>
<p>            The roles and responsibilities are required and must be laid out for this project success. All team members that are included in the list must clearly understand their responsibilities that are assigned to them to successfully perform their part of the project. The JIT Project listed the required personnel for the project and their responsibilities have been established:</p>
<p><strong>Project Manager (PM), (1 position): </strong>responsible for the decision and communications for the overall success of the JIT Project. The PM roles decide whether to authorize and approve of all project expenditures. The PM is also responsible for monitoring the work activities and team member performance meet established acceptability criteria and fall within acceptable variance. The PM will be responsible for monitoring the JIT Project status in accordance with the communications management plan. The PM will monitor and evaluate the performance of all project team members and report their performance to the functional managers. The PM will give the final verdict of acquiring human resources for the project through coordination with functional managers. The PM will handle the relationship, scheduling, budgeting, communications, and overall decision for the project.</p>
<p><strong>Document Analyst (DA), (1 position): </strong>responsible for organizing and documenting the project charter, business case, stakeholder strategy, scope, cost, schedule, quality, human resources, communications, procurement, risk, and implementation management plan. They will handle if there are any changes in one of the important documents. They are most active members of the project team because they need to confer with the project manager and other team members such as quality analyst and developers through documents. They are also responsible for editing and proofreading documents for grammar, correct spelling, and clarity of the documents. They will be required to interview project team members regarding existing documents, so they could improve upon, modify, and enhance JIT Project literature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Financial Consultant (FC), (1 position):</strong> is an external position or member that is responsible for offering information and guidance on topics that include taxes, investments, and cost-benefit decisions for the JIT Project Management. The consultant does not necessarily join the team throughout the project but only during the planning phase of the JIT Project Management to offer personalized financial advice. The consultant may also direct to the client negotiating the cost management relation to the schedule of the JIT Project. The consultant will meet personally with the JIT Team members and client to assess their financial situation to present a financial plan that cover the duration of the project term and after the project term. The consultant may also help the JIT Project team with the staffing of the team members.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Digital Designer (Digi Art), (1 position):</strong> responsible for leading and producing the design function for the JIT Project. The position is also responsible for delivering effective, aesthetic, original brand, and on-strategy designs for the JIT Project’s website graphics, logo including photographs that are related to the JIT Project, advertisements, email templates, social media designs, and banned ads. The Digital Designer will work together with the Front-End Developers, and work closely with the Project Manager, Back-End Developers, and Project Adviser for the approval of the graphics.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Business Analyst (BA), (1 position): </strong>responsible for determining the operational objectives of the JIT Project whether it has met the business objectives of the client by studying business functions and gathering information. They are also responsible for evaluating workflow charts and diagrams. They are also required to study the JIT Project capabilities and improve the JIT Project by aligning it to the business objectives thus they are assigned in designing modifications of the JIT Project. The business analyst contributes to the JIT Project by defining requirements, monitoring the project progress, analyzing, summarizing and validating the resources or information related to the business process of the JIT Project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>System Developer (BED), (2 position):</strong>  responsible for creating, coding, and improving the server, server-side website application, and database of JIT Project which must be synchronized with the front-end codes created by the FED, aiding the user to have a functional, seamless experience.

<h2>Staffing Management</h2>
<h2>Staff Acquisition:</h2>
<p>            For the JIT Project, the project staff will consist of three teams; the Project Management Team, Development Team, and Quality Team. The planning stage is where the project team would outsource and contract members or external entities that would aid the project team to success. The Project Manager will negotiate with the functional leaders in the team to identify required skills and resources that must be allocated in accordance with the project management structure. All staff and resources must be approved by the relevant functional leader before the staff and resources may begin any project work. The project team will share location of the project to ensure the consistency throughout the whole project.</p>
<h2>Resource Calendars:  </h2>
<p>            The JIT Project development will last for ten months including the planning, quality testing, and closeout documents. All resources must be identified and evaluated before the project can start. The resources histogram illustrates that the project team are split into three teams mainly Project Management, Development, and Quality team. They are required to perform between specific times to complete a task assigned to the team which explains the shift in the required hours each month. The Project Management Team required to perform 8 hours a day which will accumulate to 185 hours per month within the one to two months and nine to ten months of JIT Project. The job of Project Management is to guide the other teams on the tasks assigned to them.</p>
<p>            The Project Development Team is required to perform 8 hours a day and 185 hours per month within the three months to eight months of JIT Project Development since within this time they are the one developing the JIT Project. After the required months the required hours will begin to lessen. The Quality Management team has the most inconsistent required of hours because they need an output first before performing their task. In the first three months of the JIT Project they don’t have any hours of required at all since they do not have any work assigned to them yet. After three months, they are required to perform at least four to five hours of time. During the last two months, the required time begins to increase.</p>

<h2>Training:</h2>
<p>There is no training schedule with regards to the JIT Project since the Project Management outsource staff has the required skills sets. However, if training requirements are identified, funding will be provided from the project reserve.</p>
<h2>Performance Reviews:  </h2>
<p>Before releasing project resources, the project manager will review other team leader’s evaluation report of their member’s assigned work activities at the onset of the project and communicate all expectations of work to be performed. The project manager will then evaluate the performance of each team member throughout the project to see how effectively they are completing their assigned work.</p>

=Work Breakdown Structure=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            The Work Breakdown Structure is breakdown of all the work packages necessary to complete, presented here represents all the work required to complete this project. A WBS is constructed Outline View Structure to develop to easily navigate and understand the structure how to accomplish this project, it also represents the work identified in the approved Project Scope Statement and serves as an Initial Schedule Development and Cost Estimating. We do the WBS is help more accurately and specifically define and organize the scope of the whole project. Also, to help with assigning responsibilities, resource allocation, monitoring and controlling the project.</p>

<h2>Glossary of Terms </h2>
<p><strong>Scrum</strong> – is a process encourages practitioners to work with what they have and continually evaluate what is working and what is not working. Communication, which is an important part of the process, is carried out through meetings, called Events. Sprint Planning Meeting - a sprint refers to the time frame in which work must be completed, and it's often 30 days. Everyone participates in setting the goals, and at the end, at least one increment -- a usable piece of software -- should be produced.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint Review</strong> - this is the time to show off the increment. Sprint Retrospective - is a meeting that's held after a Sprint ends. During this meeting, everyone reflects on the Sprint process. A team-building exercise may also be offered. An important goal of a Sprint Retrospective is continuous improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint backlog</strong> - is a list of tasks that must be completed before selected product backlog items can be delivered. These are divided in to time-based user stories.</p>
<p><strong>Product increment</strong> - refers to what's been accomplished during a Sprint -- all the product backlog items as well as what's been created during all previous Sprints. The product increment reflects how much progress has been made.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud integration</strong> - is the process of configuring multiple application programs to share data in the cloud. In a network that incorporates cloud integration, diverse applications communicate either directly or through third-party software.</p>
<p><strong>Risk management</strong> - is the process of identifying, assessing and controlling threats to an organization's capital and earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Project Charter</strong> - is a formal, typically short document that describes your project in its entirety including what the objectives are, how it will be carried out, and who the stakeholders are.</p>
<p>Level of Effort:       Level of Effort (LOE) is how much work is required to complete a task.</p>
<p>WBS Code:              A unique identifier assigned to each element in a Work Breakdown Structure for designating the elements hierarchical location within the WBS.</p>
<p>Work Package:         A Work Package is a deliverable or work component at the lowest level of its WBS branch.</p>
<p>WBS Component:    A component of a WBS which is located at any level.  It can be a Work Package or a WBS Element as there's no restriction on what a WBS Component is.</p>
<p>WBS Element:         A WBS Element is a single WBS component and its associated attributes located anywhere within a WBS.  A WBS Element can contain work, or it can contain other WBS Elements or Work Packages.</p>

=Procurement Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	The procurement Management plan sets the plans for obtaining requirements for the development to closure. It will serve as a guide for managing obtaining requirements in the JIT Project and will updated if there are any changes in the plan that involves acquisition of requirements. This plan identifies the related technologies to be obtain as listed in the requirements as well as the justification why would it require and when should the technologies should be obtained. This plan also identifies the type of contract to be used, risk associated with procurement management, of course, includes a mitigation plan, determining the cost the procured technologies and how are the JIT Project are going to used it, how multiple suppliers will be managed, contract approval process, decision criteria. This plan would layout how critical procurement and contracts are coordinated with the JIT&rsquo;s Project scope, budget, and schedule or any constraints relevant to procurement, and performance metrics for the procurement activities. This also includes the identification of the sellers.
</p>
<h2>Procurement Management Approach</h2>
<p>
	The Project Manager will oversight and manage for all procurement activities in JIT Project. The Project manager will collaborate with the project team to identify all technologies that are required to procure for the succession of the JIT project. The Meeting will be held to be reviewed the list of procurement as well as description why the JIT Project Management would need them prior to submitting it to the contracts and purchasing department. The result of the meeting would determine whether the list of procurements is valid and reasonable to make or buy the items, then it will start selecting stores, bidding, purchasing, and the contracting process.
</p>
<h2>Cost Determination and Procurement Definition</h2>
<p>
	The JIT Project Management will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to obtain proposal from numerous services which will describe the advantages of their services to meet the JIT Project Requirements and the cost of the subscription. All the proposal must include the vendors services of Host Server Capabilities, Security, Performance, and the Subscription Cost. The Vendor must outline how the service should be rendered, who are the personnel the service, the vendor&rsquo;s experience in providing customer support from the service, Customer feedbacks, Background of the employees performing the service, and a line-service breakdown of all cost. Additionally, the vendors will be required to submit work breakdown structures (WBSs) and work schedules to show their understanding of the work to be performed and their ability to meet the project schedule.
</p>
<p>
	All information must be included in each proposal as the proposals will be used as the foundation of our selection criteria. Proposals which omit solicited information or contain incomplete information will be discarded from consideration.
</p>
<p>
	The following list of items or services, justification, and timeline are the identified items that is essential to complete the JIT Project. Note that the table is the list of items waiting for approval of the Project Management for them to review and analyze.

<p>
	Project Client
</p>
<p>
	Project Adviser
</p>
<p>
	Project Director
</p>
<h2>Type of Contract to be Used</h2>
<p>
	All services to be procured for the JIT Project will be requested through Time and Material contracts (T&amp;M). The JIT Project Management decided T&amp;M because most of the procured are services subscription. Additionally, the JIT Project requires to have a research and development to ensure that the JIT Project will improve the state of business as per stated in the scope. The Project Management will work with the contracts and purchasing department to define the subscription types, plans, services, and customer support. The Project Management will search services available online from various stores to procure the service within the required period and at a reasonable cost under the T&amp;M once the service is selected.
</p>
<h2>Procurement Risks</h2>
<p>All procurement activities also have potential risk attach to them which the JIT Project must anticipate and prepare a backup plan or mitigation plan to ensure that project is still on the schedule. While all risk will be list down and managed in the JIT Project&rsquo;s Risk Management Plan, there are specific risk that are risk or problem to procurement which must be considered:</p>
<ul>
<ul>Weather conditions expectations of having unstable connection.</ul>
<ul>Internet connection service failure.</ul>
<ul>Poor Customer Service</ul>
<ul>Security Breach of Services</ul>
<ul>Questionable past service performance</ul>
<ul>Conflicts with current contracts and store relationships</ul>
<ul>Unrealistic service and cost expectations for vendors</ul>
<ul>Configuration management for upgrades and improvements of purchased technology</ul>
<ul>Potential service failure and impacts on cost and schedule</ul>
<ul>Potential that final product does not meet required specifications</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	The list does not cover all the potential risk in the service therefore standard risk management process of identifying, documenting, analyzing, mitigating, and managing risks will be used.
</p>

<h2>Procurement Risk Management</h2>
<p>
	The JIT Project Risk Management plan stated that all project risk involved with the JIT Project will be managed. However, for the risk related to procurement, there must be additional consideration since the vendors are not part of the JIT Project Management but as a third-party organization and potentially affect current and future business relationship as well as the internal service business operations. Because of these facts, The JIT Project Management will include the representative from the contracting department in all procurement meetings and status reviews.
</p>
<h2>Standardized Procurement Documentation</h2>
<p>
	The Project Management must utilize the cost and resource of the Project as well as to simplify the procurement management mean to facilitate successful completion of the contract and project. The JIT Project Management will use standard documentation for all the steps for the procurement process. Due to the reason that it provides adequate levels of detail which allows for easier comparison of proposal, more accurate pricing, more detailed responses and more efficient management of contract and vendors.
</p>
<p>
	The following standard documents will be used for project procurement activities:
</p>
<ul>
	<ul>
		Standard Request for Proposal Template to include
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<ul>
		Background
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Proposal process and timelines
	</ul>
	<ul>

	</ul>
	<ul>
		Terms and Conditions
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<ul>
		Internal source selection evaluation forms
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Non-disclosure agreement
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Letter of intent
	</ul>
	<ul>
		T&amp;M contract
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Procurement audit form
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Procurement performance evaluation form
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Lessons learned form
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Procurement Constraints</h2>
<p>
	There are several constraints that must be considered as part of the project&rsquo;s procurement management plan. These constraints will be included in the RFP and communicated to all vendors to determine their ability to operate within these constraints. These constraints apply to several areas which include schedule, cost, scope, resources, and technology:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		Schedule:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		Project schedule of procurement activities, contract administration, and contract fulfillment is must be established in the JIT Project Management. Any request of changes with these activities must go through the process of change control.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		If any risk occurred, it must be mitigate as soon as possible using the mitigation plan created for the procurement. Any request of change schedule and budget must go through the process of JIT Project Schedule Management.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Cost:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		Project budget has contingency and management reserves built in; however, these reserves may not be applied to procurement activities. Reserves are only to be used in the event of an approved change in project scope or at management&rsquo;s discretion.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Since the procured services can be procured at the close out of the JIT Project Management, specifically the turn-over of the Website. If there is any delay occurred, it can be ignored and change the schedule.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Scope:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		All the procured services must be justified to what cause would the JIT Project to have gain in said services. All the procurement activities must comply to the JIT Project scope such as the target budget, efficiency of the Website, etc., if there are any activities that does not relate to the project scope will be identified as out of scope.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Resources:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		All procured services are within the planned budget therefore must be perform and manage by the project manager accordingly to the plan. There will be no additional personnel to manage the activities nor re-allocated to support the procurement activities on this project.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Technology:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		The services have already been identified by the project team and will be included in the statemen of work as part of the RFP. While the vendor&rsquo;s&rsquo; proposal may include suggestion or alternative to the procured services but must keep in mind that it will be same service in the statement of work.
	</ul>

<h2>Decision Criteria</h2>
<p>
	The criteria for the selection and award of procurement contracts under this project will be based on the following decision criteria:
</p>
<ul>
	<ul>
		Vendor&rsquo;s Customer Support
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Performance
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Quality
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Cost
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Comparison of outsourced cost versus in-sourcing
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Past performance
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	These criteria will be measured by the Project Manager. The ultimate decision will be made based on these criteria as well as available resources.
</p>

<h2>Vendor Management</h2>
<p>
	The Project Manager is responsible for searching for the vendors as well as managing them. The Project Manager and the vendor will meet weekly with the contract and each vendor will discuss the services they offer and status. The meeting can be in person or by telecommunications. The purpose of the meetings to have an agreement between the vendor and the project manager because the project manager will inspect the service whether is good or not. This also will give the project manager whether the service is capable enough to comply with the project requirements establish in the project objectives. It also serves as an opportunity to ask questions. The project manager will be responsible for scheduling this meeting until the end of the contract.
</p>
<h2>Performance Metrics for Procurement Activities</h2>
<p>
	While the Subscribing and contracts department has their own internal metrics for procurement, the following metrics are established for vendor performance for this project&rsquo;s procurement activities. Each metric is rated on a 1-3 scale as indicated below:
</p>
<table border="1" width="70%" align="center">

<p>
	In addition to rating each vendor, actual values will be noted to build a past-performance data base for selecting vendors for future procurement activities.
</p>

=Risk Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            The JIT Project Management anticipated that risk and uncertainty of event that comes along with developing new and unique project. That said, the JIT Project Management takes advantage of the anticipated results by creating Risk Management Plan. The purpose of the Risk Management Plan is to establish the framework in which the JIT Project team will identify risk and developing strategies to counter act or avoid those risk. However, before risk can be identified and managed, there are preliminary project elements which must be completed. These elements are outlined in the risk management approach.</p>
<p>This project is considered a high-risk project as its function is to be the main transaction for the company of MC Manabat. The project’s function involves money transaction and confidential information transfer between the process of the JIT Project’s website, so the security of the website must be tested and check regularly to avoid implications within the business.</p>
<p>Before risk management begins it is imperative that a foundation is established for providing structured project information, thus, the following project elements were completed and defined prior to developing this Risk Management Plan:</p>
<ul>
	<ul><strong>Scope, Schedule, and Cost Management Plan must first be established to include:</strong></ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>Estimation of JIT Project cost and finalization of budget.</ul>
		<ul>Established Performance Metric System</ul>
		<ul>Identify the Work Modules of the JIT Project</ul>
		<ul>Identify the available Resources for the Project.</ul>
		<ul>Established a Work Schedule relative to the Work Modules.</ul>
		<ul>Developer Project WBS/WBS Dictionary.</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul><strong>Define the scope and limitation of the following:</strong></ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>Schedule Management Plan</ul>
		<ul>Cost Management Plan</ul>
		<ul>Quality Management Plan</ul>
		<ul>Stakeholder Management Plan</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<ul><strong>Define Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities</strong></ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>Project Manager chairs the risk assessment meetings</ul>
		<ul>Project team participates in risk assessment meetings and members serve as meeting recorder and timekeeper</ul>
		<ul>Key stakeholders participate in risk assessment meetings</ul>
		<ul>Project Adviser may participate in risk assessment meetings</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Top Three Risks</h2>
<p>The top three high probability and high impact risks to The JIT Project are:</p>
<p><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></p>
<p>Due to the Internet of things gradually growing more of the securities are breach and it is important to the JIT Project especially dealing with money transaction to prevent or create a mitigation plan when event happens. The project manager will ensure that the risk of prevent or mitigate authorized person to hi-jack or acquire confidential information in the JIT Project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Time Management</strong></p>
<p>Due to the uncertainty of event that the Project Management assumes that will happen throughout the Project that will result in delaying of the project schedule as well as wasting resources for the JIT Project requires a plan of action of the process that will happen in case a problem event occurs. The Project Manager will mitigate the risk for the problems that will happen in the future and will have a back-up plan a ready.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Consistency of the Project </strong></p>
<p>Due to ineffective methodology and practice can lead the Project Management to have a risk in the Consistency of the project that will result in unintentional change of plans in the Project that will lead a dissatisfaction and disappointment of the Project Stakeholders and Client of the project. The project manager will mitigate the risk and it will require the members to adjust so that the Project Management will use as the standard practice.</p>
<h2>Risk Management Approach</h2>
<p>            The risk analysis regarding information systems that JIT Project Management have taken approach to manage risk for this project which the Project Management identified and ranked the various risks. The Project Team prioritize the highest impact risk were added to project schedule to ensure that the risk would minimize its probability of becoming a problem as well as taking the necessary precaution to implement the mitigation response plan at the appropriate time. Team leaders assigned in the risk management will inform status updates on their assigned risks and must be updated weekly by having the meetings with the project manager, but only when the meetings include their risk’s planned timeframe. Before the completion of the project, during closing process, the project manager will analyze the risk as well as the process to it. Based on the analysis, the project manager will identify any improvements that can be added to the risk management process for the Project Client to know as part of the maintenance of the website after the turnover has happened.</p>
<h2><strong>Risk Identification</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>            For the JIT Project, risk analysis method used by the Project team to identify risk is Qualitative Risk Analysis. The risk assessment meeting representatives discuss and create scenarios that outline the potential threats to the business and rank these threats according to the severity of the potential problems if it occurred. The procedure writing scenarios for the major risk, estimating the effects of event, if it happened, and creating a counter measures and safeguards against the event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Simulation Test</strong></p>
<p>One Security Analyst (SA) is involved in the project. The SA will simulate cyber-attack against the JIT Project to test the website whether the penetration of the SA will be successful, or the website would safely be unaffected by the attack. The result will be documented, and the JIT Project will be improved based on the comments and suggestion of the SA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reserve Funds</strong></p>
<p>A risk assessment meeting discussing allocating resources for uncertainty of events and must be only used when occurrence of the problem arises in the project management.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Daily Team Meeting</strong></p>
<p>Each team leader must discuss the status of their members about work assigned to them, what are the issues that they encounter, what solutions they need to work on, and what they will do for the day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risk Assessment Meeting</strong></p>
<p>A risk assessment meeting was held with key team leaders and stakeholders. The risks identified during this meeting were added to the project plan and Risk Table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Historical Review of Similar Projects</strong></p>
<p>The project team reviewed the history of similar projects to determine the most common risks and the strategies used to mitigate those risks.</p>

<h2>Risk Qualification and Prioritization</h2>
<p>            To determine the severity of the risk that will be identified by the team, a probability and impact was used as metric to the assigned risk. This process allowed the team leaders and project manager to prioritize risk based on the severity of the effect that the risk would have on the project. The project manager utilized a probability-impact matric to manage the team leader in moving each risk to the appropriate place on the table. Once the risks were assigned a probability and impact and placed in the appropriate position on the table, documenting the finished website and the project manager moved the process on to the next step: risk mitigation/avoidance planning.</p>
<h2>Risk Monitoring</h2>
<p>            The project schedules an assigned team member for each risk. During the daily meeting between leaders and members is assigned for each risk. The meeting will discuss the status of their work and as well as the risk associated to it. There will be a discussion of risk if the team member is assigned to do the work module with risk probability to it. Risk monitoring will be a continuous process throughout the life of the JIT Project. As risk approach on the JIT project the project manager will check the team leader’s status report of risk management of their members as well as the leaders with necessary status updates which include the risk status, identification of trigger conditions, and the documentation of the risk response.</p>
<h2>Risk Mitigation and Avoidance</h2>
<p>            The project manager ensures to aid team leader in developing and improving responses to each identified risk. As more risk are identified, if the risk is qualified based on the metric established, the team has to respond to develop avoidance and mitigation strategies to the risk. The identified risk will be also added to the risk register or in the table and the project plan to ensure that they are monitored when the work involves those risk.</p>
<p>            The risk for the JIT Project will be managed and controlled within the constraints of schedule, authority, and budget cost. All identified risk will be analyzed to determine how the risk will impact the time, scope, cost. The project manager with the assistance of the project team experts will determine the efficient way to deal with each risk to ensure that everything goes according to plan. There will be cases that it will be necessary to allow the project to extend its budget cost. If only necessary to allow the JIT Project for more resources to meet the deadline and requirements of the JIT project.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Register</strong></p>
<p>            The Risk Register is a log or list of all identified risk of the JIT Project. The list consists of risk description of their probability and impact, the category they belong to, mitigation strategy, and what event would trigger them. The risk register was identified in the project management meeting led by the project manager. During this meeting, the project team identified that there is a need of creating a risk management plan that the project team categorized each risk. In addition, the team assigned each risk will prioritize according to the probability and impact of the risk it could potentially have. The risk register also describes the mitigation strategy on each risk.</p>
<p>The identified risk in the risk register, each risk has been classified and added to the project plan. When the work module contains a risk—prior to when the risk is going to occur—the project manager will assign a leader to ensure adherence to the agreed mitigation strategy. Each assigned leader will provide the status of the risk relevant to their group in their daily project meeting.</p>

=Communication Management Plan=

<h2>Introductions</h2>
<p>The reason of creating a Communications Management Plan is for the project team to determine what are the communication requirements for the project and how information will be delivered. Communications Management Plan will be the one setting the scheme for the communications of the project, it will serve as a guide for the project team members throughout the duration of the project and it will only be changed or updated when needed. It also determines and describe the roles of persons involved in the project.</p>
<h2>Communication Management Approach</h2>
<p>The project manager will be the one responsible in ensuring effective communications on this project. The project manager will be allocating most of his time looking out for the project and reporting the performance of the project to the project team members and stakeholders, he will also be responsible organizing meeting, creating the project plan, constructing and reading emails, meeting with his project team members and managing the work being performed by them.</p>
<p>By having a good communication management approach a lot of project management problems can be prevented.</p>
<h2>Communication Management Constraints</h2>
<p>            Every project is no exception to limitation and constraints because they must be within the scope of the project and comply with its budget, scheduling and resource necessity. So the project planning and documentation is also limited and constrained. There must be an administrative or organizational policy requirements that must be followed as part of communications management and these constraints must be clearly discussed to all the project stakeholders and make sure that all of them have understood.</p>
<p>            All activities in the project communication will appear within the project’s approved budget, schedule and resource allocations. The one who will be responsible in ensuring that all communication activities are performed by the project team without external resources that may affect the budget and exceed the authorized budget is the project manager.</p>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<p>Roles and responsibilities for schedule development are as follows:</p>
