=Company Profile=
<h2>Brief Background:</h2>
<p>Ms. Devilyn C. Ligligen is the owner of a small-scale retail outlet situated on Mt. Makiling St., Post Proper Southside, Makati City. She caters to sari-sari stores and a diverse range of customers in the surrounding vicinity, providing goods for both wholesale and retail transactions.</p>

=Business Case=
==1. Executive Summary==
<p>Bregghan Mini Grocery Store is a family-owned business that supplies retail, wholesale, and bulk products to residents and sari-sari stores in the area. The store's current system for tracking sales and stocks is manual, using pen and paper, which has led to difficulty in monitoring inventory and potential loss of sales due to items being out of stock.</p>

<p>To address these pain points, our team aims to develop a responsive webapp that digitizes the recording of stocks and sales, notifies the user when stocks are at a critical level, and automates the computation of sold items. In addition, the webapp will also produce a basic report that shows the items sold. </p>

<h3>1.1 Issue</h3>
<p>Manual inventory tracking: </p>
<p>The current system at Bregghan mini grocery store involves manual recording of stocks and sales on paper, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The lack of a proper inventory management system can result in out-of-stock items and missed sales opportunities.  </p>

<p>Inefficient sales tracking</p>
<p>The current sales tracking process relies on hand-written receipts, which can lead to errors in the computation of items sold and total sales. This can result in inaccurate sales data and hinder the store's ability to make informed business decisions. </p>

<p>Lack of real-time monitoring</p>
<p>Without a digital system, the staff at Bregghan mini grocery store are unable to monitor stocks and sales in real-time. This can result in missed opportunities to replenish stock levels and can make it difficult for the store to keep up with customer demand. </p>

<h3>1.2 Anticipated Outcomes</h3>
<p>Improved inventory management: </p>
<p>The implementation of a digitized sales and stock tracking system will allow Bregghan mini grocery store to have accurate and real-time data on their inventory. This will enable them to make informed decisions on when to replenish stock, which products to order, and how much stock to order, leading to a reduction in stock outs and overstocking. </p>

<p>Increased sales: </p>
<p>With the implementation of a Point-of-Sale (POS) system, the checkout process will be faster and more efficient. Customers will have a better experience and may be more likely to return. The system will also be able to generate reports on the top-selling products, which can help the store to make informed decisions on product placement and marketing strategies. </p>

<p>Reduced errors: </p>
<p>The automated computation of items sold will significantly reduce the occurrence of human errors, which can lead to miscounting of inventory and discrepancies in sales records. This will result in more accurate sales and inventory data. </p>

<p>Increased productivity: </p>
<p>The implementation of a digitized sales and stock tracking system will reduce the workload of the staff, as they will no longer have to manually record sales and inventory. This will free up their time, allowing them to focus on other tasks that can improve the store's operations. </p>

<h3>1.3 Recommendation</h3>
<p>To address the identified business problem of inefficient stock and sales monitoring at Bregghan mini grocery store, we recommend developing a responsive web application that digitizes the recording of stocks and sales, automates computation of sold items, and produces reports for daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly records. By implementing this solution, the staff and manager of Bregghan mini grocery store will be able to monitor stocks and sales in real-time, reducing workload and minimizing human error. This will lead to more efficient inventory management and faster checkouts, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and retention. The system will also provide alerts when stock levels reach a critical point, allowing the store to replenish inventory on time and avoid potential revenue loss due to out-of-stock items. Furthermore, the application's capability to produce detailed sales reports will provide useful insights to the business, allowing for data-driven decision-making to further optimize operations and profitability. Overall, we believe that the proposed solution will address the identified business problem and provide significant benefits to Bregghan mini grocery store, its staff, and its customers. </p>

<h3>1.4 Justification </h3>
<p>Bregghan mini grocery store recognizes the need for improvement in its operational processes, particularly in sales and inventory tracking. The current manual system in place is time-consuming and prone to errors, hindering overall efficiency. To address these challenges, the store proposes implementing a digitized system that offers numerous benefits. </p>

<p>The key stakeholder of the project would be Ms. Devilyn Ligligen. She is the owner of the Bregghan mini grocery store and she will be the one using the project along with her personnel(cashier). All the necessary features that are requested by the client should be included hence, she will have a weekly check-up on the team to monitor the progress and to ensure that her requirements are met.</p>

==Stakeholder Analysis==
<p>The stakeholder that the project has is Ms. Devilyn Ligligen. She is the client of the team and is categorized as the priority during the development of the project. Her needs/requirements should be adhered by the team and all of her requests must be taken into consideration. Furthermore, the client should always be present during meetings for her to monitor the progress of the team and to make sure that all her requirements are met. The technique that the team would incorporate is the SWOT analysis. This will help the team identify the things that the client lacks and it helps them understand the potential impact that the stakeholder could have on the project.</p>

</ul>

=Scope Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The bregghan minigrocery store now keeps track of the inventories and sales that come in and leave out of the store each day with a pen and paper. Additionally, the store's current point-of-sale system relies on manual computation and handwritten receipts. Additionally, the fast-and slow-moving items in the mini-grocery store are not being properly tracked, and the stocks are only replenished when they notice that an item is already out of stock. </p>

<p>Before implementing the project objectives the team gathered as much requirements from the client to know more about the situation of bregghan mini grocery store and to establish a solid foundation for the project objective as well as the deliverables that will be met within every sprint. Moreover the store only uses receipt records to keep track of its sales and inventory, which is tedious for the staff because they must maintain the receipts in order to know what stock is still available and because they only rely on the data contained in those receipts. The group wants to enhance their present system by integrating a stock and sales responsive webapp, which can enhance the store's inventory management and point of sale.Therefore by the end of the project or the deployment the bregghan point of sales system should demonstrate the digitizing of the mini grocery stores sales operations easing the use and calculation of all products that are bought by the customer. The deliverables for the project consists of progress reports mainly documentations that updates real time and the final product itself. </p>

==Scope Management Approach==
<p>The scope approach of the project team ensures that every deliverable will be given in allotted time to the Product Owner or Client. The client's criteria, which include a system that allows users to efficiently obtain copies of the goods that are sold, a sales and stock tracer, and other requirements, are the only ones that can be included in the project's management scope. </p>

<p>As for who has the authority and responsibility the product owner is held accountable for the outcomes as for the scope measure to when we can call it verified for deployment the project will reach completion stage once all inquiry of the client is met and all commands that are developed by the project team are implemented from back to front end. The project deliverables are verified or approved by the client and the scrum master as well as the project adviser before final changes. </p>

==Scope Definition==
<p> The project’s scope is limited to the requirements which are provided by the client which is the sales and stock tracer and a system wherein the user can have a copy of the items that are sold in an efficient way, and both need to be in an application. The project focuses on addressing the pain points of the Bregghan mini grocery store which is the lack of monitoring in sales, stocks, and they are limited to pen and paper only. In addition, the store only uses the receipts as a basis to track the stocks and the items that are sold.</p>

<p>The project Group followed project management steps from planning to executing in order for project deliverables to meet the date need the team also made use of meetings may it be held online  or  physical  to  conduct  instructions  and  more  clear  points  to  be  taken  from  the  project adviser to consider during the sprint of the project and finalize the scope that the project should aim. As for the documentation of the project the team updates the changes that was made during the meetings with the adviser or the client to ensure that progress is tracked within each period before the said product is completed. As for the analysis of the product the use of the POS system was widely used as center for the project as the main goal being to digitize and benefit the client with an application that would help keep track of operations inside the Bregghan mini grocery store. </p>

=Cost Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Cost Management Plan is developed to ensure effective management of project costs throughout the project's lifecycle. It outlines the procedures and guidelines for measuring, reporting, and controlling costs associated with the Bregghan Mini Grocery Store project. The purpose of this plan is to identify the cost management approach, roles and responsibilities, and procedures for managing costs in a consistent and effective manner.</p>

==Cost Management Approach==
<p>The cost management approach for the Bregghan Mini Grocery Store project will be to ensure that all costs are identified and monitored throughout the project lifecycle. This will be done by tracking all costs associated with the project and comparing them against the project budget. Any deviations from the budget will be analyzed, and corrective action will be taken to keep costs within the approved budget.</p>

<p>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:</p>

<p>The following individuals will be responsible for managing costs on the Bregghan Mini Grocery Store project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Project Manager - Responsible for overseeing the project budget and ensuring that costs are managed in accordance with the approved budget.</li>
  <li>Accounting Department - Responsible for recording all project costs and ensuring that they are allocated correctly.</li>
  <li>Project Team - Responsible for providing accurate and timely cost data</li>
</ul>

==Measuring Project Costs==
<p>In this section, the method for measuring the project's costs is outlined. The PMBOK places emphasis on the use of Earned Value Management as a tool for measuring and managing project costs. Given the comprehensive nature of Earned Value Management, it is suggested that project managers undergo formal training in this area.</p>

<p>The project team intends to assess the project's schedule performance by computing the Schedule Variance (SV) through subtracting the Planned Value (PV) from the Earned Value (EV). The Earned Value refers to the actual value obtained in the project, while the PV pertains to the value anticipated in the project plan for the current point. By taking into account the deviation between the planned and actual value, the project team can determine if the project is on schedule, ahead of schedule, or behind schedule, according to the baseline schedule in the project plan.</p>

<p>The team will determine the budget performance of the project by calculating the Cost Variance (CV), which is obtained by subtracting Actual Costs (AC) from Earned Value (EV). EV represents the actual value earned in the project, while AC reflects the actual costs incurred to date. Therefore, by subtracting the actual costs from the EV, the team can determine whether the budget are above or below budget. If the CV is zero, it means the project is on budget. A CV greater than zero indicates that you are earning more value than planned, and the project is under budget.</p>

<p>Thea team will use Schedule Performance Index (SPI) to evaluate the actual progress made against the planned progress. It is calculated by dividing EV by PV. If the value of EV is equal to PV, then the SPI is 1. If EV is lower than PV, then the SPI is less than 1, which indicates that the project is running behind schedule. If EV is greater than PV, then the SPI is greater than 1, which indicates that the project is ahead of schedule. An efficient project should have an SPI that is as close to 1 as possible, or perhaps even slightly below 1.</p>

<p>The team will use Cost Performance Index (CPI) to compare the value of the work completed to the actual cost of that work. The formula for CPI is EV/AC, where EV represents the actual value earned in the project and AC represents the actual costs incurred to date. If the CPI equals 1, the project is on budget. If the CPI is greater than 1, the project is under budget, and if the CPI is less than 1, the project is over budget.</p>

==Reporting Format==

<p>Reporting for cost management will be included in the monthly project status report.  The Monthly Project Status Report will include a section labeled, “Cost Management”.  This section will contain the Earned Value Metrics identified in the previous section.  All cost variances outside of the thresholds identified in this Cost Management Plan will be reported on including any corrective actions which are planned.  Change Requests which are triggered based upon project cost overruns will be identified and tracked in this report. </p>

==Cost Variance Response Process==
<p>The Control Thresholds for this project is a CPI or SPI of less than 0.8 or greater than 1.2.  If the project reaches one of these Control Thresholds a Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan is required.  The Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with options for corrective actions within five business days from when the cost variance is first reported.  Within three business days from when the Project Sponsor selects a corrective action option, the Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with a formal Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan.  The Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan will detail the actions necessary to bring the project back within budget and the means by which the effectiveness of the actions in the plan will be measured.  Upon acceptance of the Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan it will become a part of the project plan and the project will be updated to reflect the corrective actions.</p>

==Cost Change Control Process==
<p>The cost change control process will follow the established project change request process.  Approvals for project budget/cost changes must be approved by the project sponsor.</p>

==Project Budget==
<p>The budget for this project is detailed below.  Costs for this project are presented in various categories:</p>

=Time Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The  Schedule  Management  Plan  offers  instructions  for  creating,  tracking,  and  managing  the project schedule.  It  contains details on the  creation of the schedule, the identification of project milestones, the tracking and reporting of progress, and the management of schedule adjustments. The  schedule  management  plan  will also include  on how  the  team  will  monitor  the  project’s schedule and manage the changes with accordance to the approved baseline schedule. </p>

==Schedule Management Approach==
<p>The purpose of this schedule management approach is to create an outline for the processes that will be used for the project. This section of the paper will also make sure that the project will be completed on time, within the given budget, and the features and requirements of the  client are met. The roles and  responsibilities of each member are  also stated in this  section as well as the milestones for the completion of the project. </p>

<p>Roles and Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Manager: responsible for the project management and schedule management. </li>
<li>Project Team: responsible for the completion of the tasks that are assigned within the given timeframe. </li>
<li>Team Scheduler: responsible for maintaining the schedule and its development. </li>
<li>Project Sponsor: reviews the proposed schedule and will approve the final schedule of the project. </li>
<li>Project Stakeholder: reviews the proposed schedule and will aid in the project’s validation. </li>
</ul>

<p>Project Milestone: </p>
<ul>
<li>Scope statement and WBS/WBS Dictionary </li>
<li>Project schedule </li>
<li>Project kickoff meeting </li>
<li>Roles and Responsibilities of each member </li>
<li>Project implementation </li>
<li>Completion of final deliverables </li>
</ul>

==Schedule Control==
<p>The schedule control will assure that the schedule is being followed and maintained by the team with  accordance  to  the  project’s  progress.  The procedure  that  the  team  will  incorporate  to manage the schedule control for the project is the schedule reporting.  </p>

<p>The  team’s project  schedule  will be constantly monitored  by  the  project  manager  and  the stakeholder. With this, any changes will be constantly reviewed. In addition, the project manager is also responsible for the updates with regards to the meetings, reports, and schedule.  </p>

<p>The project team is also responsible for the weekly updates with coordination to the project manager. Furthermore, they are the ones that will communicate any changes of dates to the project manager. </p>

<p>The project stakeholder is responsible for maintaining awareness of the project schedule and will review or approve any changes that might occur in the future with collaboration to the project manager. </p>

<p>The process of the team in order to control the schedule of the project is by using a schedule reporting. This will be done in a weekly basis and should follow the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Report of the members stating the percentage of their task completion </li>
<li>Project completion date </li>
</ul>

==Schedule Changes and Threshold==
<p>All the changes that will occur or raised will bereviewed by the project manager and will request for a meet with the team and the stakeholder for the evaluation ofthe change. With these,before achange is implemented, its effects on the project schedule and other project parameters must be assessed.After the assessment of the change, the project manager will determine if the changes should be addressedand will proceed to the submission of the schedule change request.
</p>

<p>Submittal of a schedule request change request to the project stakeholder for approval is required if either ofthe followingconditions is true: </p>
<ul>
<li>The proposed modification will either result in an individual work package's duration increasing or decreasingby 10% or more. </li>
<li>If theapproach will reduce or increase the project’s duration with regards to the schedule by 10%. </li>
</ul>

<p>With the establishment of processes and thresholdsfor the schedulechanges, the team will have control over  the  project’s  progress.  Furthermore,  having  these  will  ensure  that  all  the  changes will be monitored, reviewed, and will be addressed ina timely manner.  </p>

==Scope Change==
<p>All of the changes in project scope that are approved by the project sponsor, will require the team to assess the effect of the scope change in the current schedule. The proposal of a change would be possible is when a problem develops in the project that necessitates a significant modification of the project scope. Furthermore, any change should be approached by the team with caution as any  outcome  would positively  or  negatively  affect  the  project’s  progress. The  changes  can  be raised by any team member and the project stakeholder must receive all the change request in a form of a project change request document. </p>

=Work Breakdown Schedule=
==Introduction==
<p>The WBS is a view into the project which shows what work the project encompasses. It is a tool which helps to easily communicate the work and processes involved to execute the project. The Project Manager and project team use the WBS to develop the project schedule, resource requirements and costs. There are many ways you can present the WBS for your project; this template provides many of the most popular layouts from which you can choose. Depending on where in the Project Plan you're putting the WBS a different layout may be more suitable for you. </p>

<p>The Work Breakdown Structure presented here represents all the work required to complete this project. </p>

==Outline View==
<p>The outline view presents an easy to view and understand layout for the WBS. It is also a good layout to use when developing the WBS because you can easily make changes, especially since the Microsoft Word auto numbering feature updates the WBS Code automatically. </p>

==Tree Structure View==
<p>The Tree Structure View is the most popular format for the WBS. It presents an easy to understand view into the WBS; however, it is also tricky to create without an application specifically designed for creating this organizational chart structure. The Tree Structure below was created using only Microsoft Word and the SmartArt graphics option under the insert menu. </p>
