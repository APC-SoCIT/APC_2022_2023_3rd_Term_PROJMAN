<h2>Brief Background:</h2>
<p>Ms. Devilyn C. Ligligen is the owner of a small-scale retail outlet situated on Mt. Makiling St., Post Proper Southside, Makati City. She caters to sari-sari stores and a diverse range of customers in the surrounding vicinity, providing goods for both wholesale and retail transactions.</p>

=Business Case=
==Executive Summary==
<p>Bregghan Mini Grocery Store is a family-owned business that supplies retail, wholesale, and bulk products to residents and sari-sari stores in the area. The store's current system for tracking sales and stocks is manual, using pen and paper, which has led to difficulty in monitoring inventory and potential loss of sales due to items being out of stock.</p>

<p>To address these pain points, our team aims to develop a responsive webapp that digitizes the recording of stocks and sales, notifies the user when stocks are at a critical level, and automates the computation of sold items. In addition, the webapp will also produce a basic report that shows the items sold.</p>

<h3>Issue</h3>

<li>Manual inventory tracking:<p>The current system at Bregghan mini grocery store involves manual recording of stocks and sales on paper, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The lack of a proper inventory management system can result in out-of-stock items and missed sales opportunities.  </p></li>

<li>Inefficient sales tracking:<p>
The current sales tracking process relies on hand-written receipts, which can lead to errors in the computation of items sold and total sales. This can result in inaccurate sales data and hinder the store's ability to make informed business decisions. </p></li>

<li>Lack of real-time monitoring:<p>
Without a digital system, the staff at Bregghan mini grocery store are unable to monitor stocks and sales in real-time. This can result in missed opportunities to replenish stock levels and can make it difficult for the store to keep up with customer demand. </p></li>

<h3>Anticipated Outcomes</h3>
<li>Improved inventory management:
<p>The implementation of a digitized sales and stock tracking system will allow Bregghan mini grocery store to have accurate and real-time data on their inventory. This will enable them to make informed decisions on when to replenish stock, which products to order, and how much stock to order, leading to a reduction in stock outs and overstocking. </p></li>

<li>Increased sales:
<p>With the implementation of a Point-of-Sale (POS) system, the checkout process will be faster and more efficient. Customers will have a better experience and may be more likely to return. The system will also be able to generate reports on the top-selling products, which can help the store to make informed decisions on product placement and marketing strategies. </p></li>

</li>

  <li>Outsourcing: The third alternative considered was to outsource the process to a third-party vendor. However, this option was rejected due to the lack of control over the process and potential security risks associated with sharing confidential company information with external parties.

<p>Pros: Outsourcing provides access to specialized skills and expertise that may not be available within the organization. This allows for the optimization of the process through industry knowledge and experience. By outsourcing, Bregghan can save costs by avoiding the need to hire and train additional staff, invest in infrastructure, and maintain software or hardware systems.</p>

<p>Cons: Outsourcing relinquishes control over certain aspects of the process, such as decision-making, quality control, and data security, potentially affecting effective management and oversight. Working with external vendors may introduce challenges related to communication and coordination, including time zone differences, language barriers, or cultural variations. These can lead to misunderstandings and project delays.</p>

=Scope Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Bregghan Mini Grocery business has adopted a traditional method of keeping records for their daily sales, using a pen and paper. Additionally, the store's current point-of-sale system depends on handwritten receipts and manual calculations to track transactions coming in and going out. The mini-grocery store only replenishes its stocks when they realize that a particular item is running critically low, and they are not efficiently keeping track of both the fast-selling and slow-selling items.</p>

<p>To establish a solid groundwork for achieving the project objectives and the desired outcomes in each sprint, the team made a concerted effort to gather as many client requirements as possible before initiating the project. This was done to gain a deeper understanding of the circumstances surrounding the Bregghan Mini-Market. Additionally, the store currently relies solely on receipt records to track sales and inventory, which places a heavy burden on the employees as they must maintain and refer to these receipts to determine the availability of stock. By integrating a responsive web application for inventory management and point of sale, the team aims to enhance the existing system and improve the store's inventory management and point of sale operations. Consequently, by the end of the project or deployment, the transition to digital sales activities in the mini grocery store should be apparent, facilitating easier use and accurate calculation of purchased items for customers. The project deliverables primarily consist of regularly updated documentation and progress reports, in addition to the final product itself.</p>

==Scope Management Approach==
<p>The scope approach of the project team ensures that every deliverable will be given in allotted time to the business owner. The client's criteria, which include a system that allows users to efficiently obtain copies of the goods that are sold, a sales and stock tracer, and other requirements, are the only ones that can be included in the project's management scope.</p>

<p>As for who has the authority and responsibility, the product manager is held accountable for the outcomes as for the scope measure to when we can call it verified for deployment. The project will reach the completion stage once all inquiries of the client are met and all commands that are developed by the project team are implemented from back to front end. The project deliverables are verified or approved by the client and the project manager before final changes.</p>

==Scope Definition==
<p>The scope of the Bregghan Point-of-Sale System involves creating and deploying a robust software solution that optimizes point of sale operations for Bregghan stores. This includes functionality for managing product inventory, processing sales transactions, handling payment, generating receipts, reports, and analytics. Additionally, the scope encompasses the hardware and infrastructure components necessary for the system's successful deployment and operation.</p>

<p>To finalize the scope of the Bregghan POS (Point of Sale) System, the project team utilized meetings, whether in-person or virtual, to ensure clear communication and alignment on the project objectives. These meetings provided an opportunity to discuss and refine instructions, address any questions or concerns, and establish a shared understanding of the desired scope. The project team, comprised of a project manager, front-end and back-end developers, and a quality assurance tester, worked collaboratively to define the specific features, functionalities, and goals that the project system should aim to achieve. Through expertise and contributions, the team ensured that the scope was comprehensive and aligned with the needs and requirements of Bregghan stores.  </p>

<p>This plan is to establish a systematic method for efficiently overseeing and regulating the financial components of the POS (Point of Sale) system project. It empowers Bregghan to make well-informed choices, optimize the allocation of resources, and guarantee that the project is accomplished within the set budgetary limitations. </p>

==Cost Management Approach==
<p>The cost management approach for the Bregghan Store POS project will be to ensure that all costs are identified and monitored throughout the project lifecycle. This will be done by tracking all costs associated with the project and comparing them against the project budget. Any deviations from the budget will be analyzed, and corrective action will be taken to keep costs within the approved budget. </p>

<p>The cost management approach for Bregghan Store POS System will be based on the following principles: </p>
<li>Clear definition of costs<p>This will create and establish an estimate financial resource required for the POS system implementation. It ensures that all relevant expenses are identified and accounted for, enabling us to develop a realistic budget.</p></li>

<li>Budget development and tracking<p>This involves creating a comprehensive budget plan that will help set clear financial parameters and constraints for the POS system project. It involves estimating the costs associated with hardware, software, licensing, implementation, training, maintenance, and any other relevant expenses. By defining the budget, this will determine the financial boundaries within which the project should be executed.</p></li>

<li>Cost estimates<p>By having a clear understanding of the anticipated costs, this will evaluate different options, assess their financial feasibility, and select the most suitable solutions for the POS system</p></li>

<li>Cost variance analysis<p>Through the comparison of actual incurred costs and budgeted costs, this will evaluate the project's alignment with the intended financial plan. This assessment allows for a comprehensive understanding of the project's effective management of financial resources.</p></li>

<li>Cost management roles and responsibilities<p>This guarantees that every team member understands their individual responsibilities in overseeing costs. With clearly defined roles, team members can actively participate in activities such as estimating costs, creating budgets, tracking expenses, and implementing cost control measures.</p></li>

<li>Approval process for changes<p>By establishing an approval process, this can thoroughly assess and evaluate any suggested modifications to the project's scope, requirements, or budget to determine their potential cost implications. This structured approach enables a thorough examination of the financial consequences before proceeding with any changes.</p></li>

<li>Reporting and communication<p>This allows for timely decision-making, as stakeholders can assess the financial health of the project and take necessary actions if deviations from the plan occur. Additionally, clear communication channels enable effective coordination and collaboration among team members, ensuring that everyone is aligned with the project's financial goals and responsibilities.</p></li>

==Measuring Project Costs==
<p>The Cost Management Plan for the Bregghan POS System project will include a detailed approach for measuring project costs using Earned Value Management (EVM). This will include analyzing and reporting on various Earned Value metrics, such as: </p>

<p>The project team intends to assess the project's schedule performance by computing the Schedule Variance (SV) through subtracting the Planned Value (PV) from the Earned Value (EV). The Earned Value refers to the actual value obtained in the project, while the PV pertains to the value anticipated in the project plan for the current point. By considering the deviation between the planned and actual value, the project team can determine if the project is on schedule, ahead of schedule, or behind schedule, according to the baseline schedule in the project plan.  </p>

<p>The team will determine the project's budget performance by calculating the Cost Variance (CV), obtained by subtracting Actual Costs (AC) from Earned Value (EV). EV represents the actual value earned in the project, while AC reflects the actual costs incurred to date. Therefore, by subtracting the actual costs from the EV, the team can determine whether the budget is above or below budget. If the CV is zero, it means the project is on budget. A CV greater than zero indicates that you are earning more value than planned, and the project is under budget.</p>

<p>Thea team will use Schedule Performance Index (SPI) to evaluate the actual progress made against the planned progress. It is calculated by dividing EV by PV. If the value of EV is equal to PV, then the SPI is 1. If EV is lower than PV, the SPI is less than 1, indicating the project is behind schedule. If EV is greater than PV, the SPI is greater than 1, indicating the project is ahead of schedule. An efficient project should have an SPI that is as close to 1 as possible, or even slightly below 1.</p>

<p>The team will utilize the Cost Performance Index (CPI) to contrast the value of completed work with the corresponding actual cost. The CPI is calculated using the formula EV/AC, with EV denoting the actual value achieved in the project and AC representing the total actual costs incurred thus far. If the CPI equals 1, the project is within the budgetary confines. If the CPI surpasses 1, the project is operating under the budget, while a CPI below 1 indicates that the project is exceeding the budget.</p>

==Reporting Format==

<p>The team will provide provides a structured and standardized way to communicate cost-related information within the project.</p>
<p>The report will include the following:</p>
<p>1. Earned Value Metrics</p>
<li>Cost Performance Index (CPI): [CPI Value] </li>
<li>Schedule Performance Index (SPI): [SPI Value] </li>
<li>Cost Variance (CV): [CV Value] </li>
<li>Schedule Variance (SV): [SV Value] </li>

<p>The monthly project status report will feature a specific segment dedicated to cost management. Within this section, the report will display the earned value metrics, including the cost performance index (CPI), schedule performance index (SPI), cost variance (CV), and schedule variance (SV). </p>

<p>2. Cost Variances</p>
<p>Any cost variances outside the thresholds specified in the Cost Management Plan will be reported, including the following details:</p>
<li>Description of the variance </li>
<li>Magnitude of the variance </li>
<li>Impact on project budget </li>
<li>Planned corrective actions to address the variance. </li>

<p>Any cost discrepancies that surpass the predetermined thresholds outlined in the Cost Management Plan will be documented and reported. This includes providing a detailed explanation of the variance, quantifying its magnitude, assessing its impact on the project budget, and outlining the corrective actions that are planned to address the deviation. </p>

<p>3. Change Requests</p>
<p>Change Requests triggered by project cost overruns will be identified and tracked in this report, including the following details: </p>
<li>Description of the change request </li>
<li>Reason for the change </li>
<li>Estimated impact on project cost. </li>
<li>Status and progress of the change request </li>
<p>Any change requests triggered by cost overruns will be identified and tracked, including their description, reason, estimated impact on project cost, and status. The report will also summarize the overall project cost, including the total budgeted cost, actual cost incurred to date, remaining budget, and estimated cost at completion. </p>

<p>4. Summary
<li>Provide a summary of the cost management status and any significant findings or observations related to project costs. </li></p>

<p>5. Attachments
<li>Include any relevant supporting documents or reports related to cost management. </li></p>

==Cost Variance Response Process==
<p>The Cost Variance Response Process for the Point-of-Sale System project is outlined below: </p>
<li>Identify and Assess Cost Variances <p>The project team reviews the financial information and evaluates it in relation to the predefined thresholds or benchmarks outlined in the Cost Management Plan. When there is a substantial difference between the actual costs and the planned budget, it signifies the presence of a cost variance. </p></li>

<li>Analyze the Causes <p>The project team will examine the underlying causes and investigate various elements such as changes in scope, unexpected expenses, resource allocation issues, inaccurate cost estimations, or external factors impacting the project budget. </p></li>

<li>Assess the Impact <p>Assess the consequences of the cost variances on the project's schedule, resources, and overall goals while considering the potential impact on other project constraints, including quality, scope, and stakeholder contentment. </p></li>

<li>Develop Corrective Actions <p>After analyzing the root causes and evaluating the consequences, the project team will identify and outline precise corrective measures to tackle the cost variances. These measures might involve modifying the budget, reallocating resources, reevaluating the project scope, or implementing cost-reduction strategies. </p></li>

<li>Implement Corrective Actions<p>The project team must implement the defined corrective actions and closely monitor their efficacy in mitigating or resolving the cost variances. This could entail adjusting the project plan, reallocating resources, renegotiating contracts, or pursuing additional funding if required </p></li>

<li>Monitor and Control<p>The project will have to monitor and regularly observe its financial progress and assess the impact of the applied corrective measures through ongoing monitoring. </p></li>

==Cost Change Control Process==
<p>The cost change control process will adhere to the existing procedure for project change requests. The team will ensure that any proposed changes related to project budget or costs are carefully evaluated, documented, and reviewed by relevant stakeholders.</p>

<li>Identification of Change <p>All suggested alterations that could affect the project's expenses are recognized and recorded. This encompasses modifications to the project's scope, requirements, resources, or any other aspect that could potentially result in financial consequences. Any proposed changes to the project budget or costs must be submitted to the project manager in writing using the Cost Change Request Form. </p></li>

<li>Change Assessment<p>The proposed change is assessed to determine its impact on the project budget. A comprehensive analysis is performed to gauge the financial implications, considering the potential increase or decrease in costs. </p></li>

<li>Cost Estimation <p>The project team evaluates the monetary consequences of the suggested alteration. This entails estimating the direct and indirect expenses linked to implementing the change, considering factors such as labor, materials, equipment, and overhead costs. </p></li>

<li>Cost Analysis <p>The analyzed cost estimates are examined to comprehend the broader effect on the project's budget. This examination aids in evaluating the practicality of the change and its alignment with the project's financial goals. </p></li>

<li>Approval Process <p>The proposed change is presented for approval using the established change management process. Relevant stakeholders such as project sponsor and key decision-makers evaluate the change request and decide considering its impact, feasibility, and alignment with the project's financial limitations. </p></li>

<li>Implementation <p>Once the change receives approval, it is executed following the agreed-upon protocols. This could entail modifying the project plan, adjusting the budget, reallocating resources, or undertaking any required measures to accommodate the approved change. </p></li>

<li>Documentation <p>All changes, including the associated costs, approvals, and implementation details, are documented for future reference.

=Schedule Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>The Schedule Management Plan offers instructions for creating, tracking, and managing the project schedule. It contains details on the schedule creation, identifying project milestones, tracking, and reporting progress, and managing schedule adjustments. The schedule management plan will also include how the team will monitor the project’s schedule and manage the changes in accordance with the approved baseline schedule. </p>

==Schedule Management Approach==
<p>This schedule management approach creates an outline for the processes used for the project. This section of the paper will also ensure that the project will be completed on time, within the given budget, and the client's features and requirements are met. All changes to the project schedule will be communicated to the stakeholders promptly. To ensure that the project is on time and in adherence to the schedule, monitoring of the project should be implemented. </p>

<li>Regular meetings are required for the team to discuss all the progress and address any issue that may arise. </li>
<li>The assigned project manager will be responsible for the regular status reports to all stakeholders and the project sponsor for them to be informed about the project's progress. </li>
<li>The assigned project manager will be responsible for monitoring the project’s progress regarding the schedule, budget, issues, potential delays, and risk mitigation. </li>
<li>The project team will utilize software on project management to attain a strong adherence to the deadlines.  </li>

==Schedule Control==
<p>The schedule control will ensure that the schedule is being followed and maintained by the team in accordance with the project’s progress. The procedure the team will incorporate to manage the project's schedule control is schedule reporting.</p>

<p>The team’s project schedule will be constantly monitored by the project manager and the stakeholder. With this, any changes will be constantly reviewed. In addition, the project manager is also responsible for the updates with regards to the meetings, reports, and schedule.</p>

<p>The project team is also responsible for the weekly updates in coordination with the project manager. Furthermore, they are the ones that will communicate any changes of dates to the project manager.</p>

<p>The project stakeholder is responsible for maintaining awareness of the project schedule and will review or approve any changes that might occur in the future in collaboration with the project manager.   </p>

<p>The team process to control the project schedule is by using schedule reporting. This will be done in a weekly basis and should adhere to the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Report of the members stating the percentage of their task completion within a given time. </li>
<li>Weekly team meetings </li>
<li>Risk and mitigation strategies raised by the project team members </li>
<li>Communication with stakeholders every week </li>
</ul>

==Schedule Changes and Threshold==
<p>All the changes that will occur or be raised will be reviewed by the project manager, and he will request a meeting with the team and the stakeholders for the change's evaluation. With these, before a change is implemented, its effects on the project schedule and other project parameters must be assessed. After the assessment of the change, the project manager will determine if the changes should be addressed and will proceed to the submission of the schedule change request which can be found at the end of this document. Only the project manager can submit the schedule change request form to the stakeholder/project sponsor. Once done, the project manager must inform the project team members about the changes and must update the project schedule. 
</p>

<p>Submittal of a schedule request change request to the project stakeholder for approval is required if either of the following conditions is true: </p>
<ul>
<li>The proposed modification will either result in an individual work package's duration increasing or decreasing by 10% or more. </li>
<li>If the approach will reduce or increase the project’s duration with regards to the schedule by 10%. </li>
</ul>

<p>With the establishment of processes and thresholds for the schedule changes, the team will have control over the project’s progress. Furthermore, having these will ensure that all the changes will be monitored, reviewed, and will be addressed in a timely manner.</p>

==Scope Change==
<p>All changes in project scope approved by the project sponsor will require the team to assess the scope change's effect in the current schedule. The proposal of a change would be possible is when a problem develops in the project that necessitates a significant modification of the project scope. Furthermore, any change should be approached by the team with caution as any outcome would positively or negatively affect the project’s progress. The changes can be raised by any team member and the project stakeholder must receive all the change requests in the form of a project change request document.</p>
