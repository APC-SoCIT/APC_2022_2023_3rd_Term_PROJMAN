= 3. COMPANY PROFILE =
<p><strong>Brief Background</strong></p>
The ITRO was set-up at the same time APC was set-up in 1994. Being an IT focused school, there was a need for a unit/department/group who would take care of IT equipment and get them ready for classes.  The group "prepared" the IT equipment in the backoffice without needing to involve the students and the faculty.  The objective was to keep the IT facilities ready for use during classes and practically anytime needed.

Maintaining IT equipment involved making sure software was always updated so this means license management, maintain software compatibility as some software did not play well with other software, Today, most are browser-based so this is much better.

Important in managing costs is making sure the software get appropriate hardware support to run it.  This means buying wisely..  knowing how computers work was very important.

In summary, the ITRO is the team who makes sure APC's mission/vision statements and plans are achieved.

= 4. BUSINESS CASE = 

== 4.1. Executive Summary ==
Through the cooperation of Asia Pacific College’s Information Technology Resource Office (APC-ITRO), Nacor Industries could help them improve their workflow and minimize any unwanted outcome that was prevalent before by making them an application suited more for their jobs as our client. The issue, anticipated outcomes, recommendation, and justification are provided in this report. 

=== 4.1.1 Issue ===
Upon meeting the head of the APC-ITRO, Mr. Castillo himself has stated that it is getting “harder and more inconvenient” for him and his team to continue their work through the same method he has been continually doing, due to their limited workforce and manpower to handle the school’s issues and queries. Even though everyone could reach them through emails, he or his agents could not always afford to get back at them and reply immediately, rendering the requests or questions futile since they would only be left unattended regardless of the urgency or importance of the task at hand. 

=== 4.1.2 Anticipated Outcomes ===
The anticipated outcome for the ITRO Client is that this software will make it easier for them to manage, prioritize, and organize the requests they will get from both instructors and students, whether they are on school premises or not. 

=== 4.1.3 Recommendation ===
The project approach is to create a dedicated system for the ITRO so that they would be able to address the requests and inquiries as soon as possible. The first step is communicating with Sir Jojo on what the ITRO needs and how it needs to be implemented and providing our own creative ideas for it. Next step is the stage where the system is being made (UI/UX. Backend) then testing and showing it to Sir Jojo if it is satisfactory. Lastly, the debugging, retesting, and deployment of the project will be done to check if the system is doing fine. We expect the system to be satisfactory for Sir Jojo, as well as the ITRO staff and also the students and teachers that would use it. 

=== 4.1.4 Justification ===
The project is being implemented to keep up with the modern era and for the school to be more efficient when it comes to dealing with requests and inquiries. 

== 4.2. Business Case Analysis Team ==
Nacor Industries is a team composed of six BSIT students from Asia Pacific College under the common goal of performing and delivering the best possible software experience for the client, APC-ITRO.

== 4.3. Problem Definition ==
=== 4.3.1. Problem Statement ===
The Asia Pacific College ITRO Department lacks a system that would help them address the school’s technical-related problems. They only use email system which often-times. ITRO personnel tend to miss out the students, teachers or staff emails regarding the problem they encountered. This might lead to a bigger problem since there are problems that need attention and action.

=== 4.3.2. Organizational Impact ===
==== Tools ====
Once the Ram’s Corner: Ticketing System is up and running. It will replace the old email system that the Department is currently using. This will require training for the ITRO personnel because the software is new and fresh. The training will provide much smoother work as they will navigate each button and functions continuously and they won’t need to guess the functions of a specific button.

==== Processes ====
With the new System made, it will boost the Department’s productivity as the system will ask its users for full details of the problem they encountered. This will reduce the time of the personnel trying to figure out what the users are trying to convey. It will reduce the manual assigning of tickets as the system will automatically personnel to resolve the problem.

==== Roles and Responsibilities ====
The department is divided into two groups. One that handles all hardware related problems and other for all software related problems. With the new system, all the ITRO personnel can focus on the fields of their expertise. In this way, the job gets to be done in a short time as the personnel who would handle the problem knows what they are doing resulting in a smooth resolution for the user’s.

==== Hardware and Software ====
The hardware will not be much of a problem as the Department already has a laptop that can run the software. As for the software needs. It does not require much, and it only needs a stable internet connection to run properly.

=== 4.3.3. Technology Migration ===
Since the legacy system utilized by the client is only email-based and the team’s system, RAMS Corner runs on the web on an entirely new environment, the team decided to pursue the migration through a systematic approach to avoid any conflicts regarding the ongoing processes within the legacy system (email-based reporting):
<h3> Phase 1: </h3>
*The development team would pull a handful of the existing userbase within the project stakeholders through their APC outlook emails for isolated testing purposes.

<h3> Phase 2: </h3>
*If the test cases were all satisfactory, then the backend developer would proceed to pull all existing userbases and build their own accounts with pre-determined credentials to be modified later by each of the stakeholders and fill the Knowledge Base with past issues raised and solved by the ITRO.

<h3> Phase 3: </h3>
*With the acknowledgement of the ITRO Head, Mr. Jojo Castillo, the ITRO are encouraged to promote the newly developed web-application by informing their clients of its existence through pre-established communication channels such as their APC emails or through a formal press release.

<h3> Phase 4: </h3>
*Since most inquiries sent through email are only being recorded and handled manually, the complete transfer of the already ongoing processes from emails to the RAMS Corner Ticketing Service System would not be advised, therefore, all new inquiries would be made in the web application, while the already ongoing ones are meant to be handled separately until completion. Inquiries that are sent through email, but have long been pending, however should be sent to the RAMS Corner to be handled. 



== 4.4. Project Overview ==
=== 4.4.1. Project Description ===
RAMS Corner Ticketing System is a web-based application that would make use of a ticketing method similar to that of Discord and other outsourcing companies that would not only help the students and teachers get an equal chance to be given audience by the ITRO, but also to provide automated questions to frequently-asked-questions through a dedicated knowledge base that would be done by surveying them before the development phase. Making troubleshooting easier and much more convenient.

=== 4.4.2. Goals and Objectives ===
The business objectives for this project are to direct support of our team’s strategic plan to provide an alternative work environment for the ITRO and improve their workflow efficiency.

*Complete implementation of the RAMS Corner Ticketing System within the next 90 days (about 3 months) to replace the current email-based system.
*Shorten time duration of ITRO’s interactions with their clients by 85% after the app deployment.
*Minimize the number of inquiries that does not reach the ITRO by at least 70%—within the next month after the full app deployment  

=== 4.4.3. Project Performance ===
The objectives which mutually support the milestones and deliverables for this project have been identified. In order to achieve success on the ISA project, the following objectives must be met within the designated time and budget allocations:

*Finish the development of the app’s user interface within the next 50 days (about 1 and a half months)
*Retrieve all the necessary data of the ITRO and their clients for the database within the next 25 days (about 3 and a half weeks)
*Present a working prototype with at least 50% of its functions realized within the next 35 days (about 1 month 4 and a half days)
*Present the beta version of the application with all its functions intact within the next 100 days (about 3 and a half months)
*Conduct an isolated deployment of the application within the next 100 days (about 3 and a half months)
*Deploy the application for the use of ITRO and their clients within the next 120 days (about 4 months)

=== 4.4.4. Project Assumptions ===
Listed below are the team’s project assumptions revolving regarding the deployment of RAMS Corner Ticketing System.

*The ITRO, as well as their clients have access to the internet through APC Rams Wi-Fi (or personal data/ISP) along with the necessary devices to use the web application.
*The ITRO Staff would be trained in using the new web application.
*The web application will be developed without any major technical issues or roadblocks.
*The web-app will be deployed by the client using their resources with sufficient processing power, memory, and storage.
*The web application will be developed within the given timeline (the entirety of PBL1).
*The APC faculty and students would utilize the new system instead of the email-based reporting system.
*The ITRO would properly launch and promote the new system.
*The email notification system will work without any issues.


=== 4.4.5. Project Constraints ===
Listed below are the possible project constraints revolving around RAMS Corner’s design and implementation which involves—but are not limited to--the following:
 
<h3> Data Privacy </h3>
*Upon takeover, the ITRO would be the one fully responsible for the web-application, and any other authorization regarding the APC faculty and the user’s credentials.

<h3> Deployment Budget </h3>
*The development team would not ask for any form of payment, and the ITRO would be the ones in charge of the system’s deployment within their budget, along with any other preceding financial needs that the app might incur.

<h3> Manpower / Workforce </h3>
*The web-application has been made with the limited manpower that the ITRO currently has, however, their lack of workforce should be dealt with to have more hands-on deck to ensure that there would always be an eye out to see the updates within the system.

<h3> Training / System Migration </h3>
*The ITRO staff are bound to learn and familiarize themselves with the new system to utilize it to its fullest extent along with its features and functionalities.

=== 4.4.6. Major Project Milestones ===

== 4.5. Strategic Alignment ==
A. The ITRO follows the following mission and objectives for each of the ITRO sub-department:

B. External environment analysis:
*Mostly, it is the growing trend and increase in volume of the demand for cloud-based technologies

C. Internal Resources and capabilities analysis:
*People: ITRO only has a few staff. These staff are highly skilled in terms of technology handling
*Process: Follows specific receive-process-deliver steps in completing a request/solving a problem. No data gathering tools are used for better decision-making.
*Technology: Equipped with latest technology tools.

D. Strategic Goals
*Launch an app that is specifically used to manage the problems and inquiries of APC Community
*Lower the requests/inquiries that are frequently asked to the ITRO by 10% very year 
*Increase the percentage of the people who are accommodated by 20% within a year
*Keep track of the interaction between ITRO and its clients as a basis for decision-making and for record-keeping 

E. Strategic Plan
*Develop a web application that is accessible both in desktop, laptop, or smartphone, with or without connectivity issues, with an uptime of 95% a year
*Include a library for solutions as a feature of the web app to lower the percentage of receiving redundant request
*Create Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the problems/request raised to the ITRO according to its impact and severity to an individual, a group of individuals or the whole APC Community
*Data analytics 

By following this strategic alignment, the ITRO can leverage or improve its internal resources and capabilities to be able to manage the external environment issues and achieve the objectives of their department whilst retaining their success in providing service for the APC Community in the following years

== 4.6. Cost Benefit Analysis ==
RAMS Corner Ticketing System, and the team of developers behind it: Nacor Industries would be working voluntarily and would not require any form of compensation from the project stakeholders aside from donations that would be very much welcome. Considering these of course, Nacor Industries is only limited to whatever hardware or time the group has for the Project Management course (PROJMAN) as of the moment. Neither the team nor the individuals are compelled to take part in any financial investments towards the development of the system since the application would be done as a requirement for the course which would take about two more terms to fully realize, or about four to five months before being deployed. Making RAMS Corner the most obvious choice for the client as it will be tailor-made and free.

== 4.7. Alternatives Analysis ==
Upon various discussions with the project stakeholders through an agile-based methodology, the team managed to list down the following as the alternatives that have been found prior to the project development:

<h3> Maintain Current System </h3>
*By maintaining ITRO’s current system, this means that they would still be using their email-based reporting and inquiry method for their clients and stakeholders. It would save them from having to implement and learn to navigate a new user interface, but they would ultimately sacrifice their productivity as it will lead to stagnation. 

<h3> Subscribe to Freshdesk </h3>
*o Freshdesk is delivered as a SaaS or Software-as-a-Service that is both powerful and easily customizable by the user. This software needs little to no training to be implemented by an organization – big or small – but it does come at a price. The set of features introduced in this software focuses on helping the users maximize their worktime by utilizing the creation and organization of tickets such as the Team Inbox for tracking the incoming tickets from a multitude of channels, Agent Collision Detection to avoid having the different personnel work on the same ticket. They also include a self-service feature so that customers can solve their own problems without the need to contact a live person by using forums and articles. They also have a feature to organize the team’s tasks so that they can improve the efficiency of their work. Despite its features though, it would not benefit ITRO all that much as they are just a small organization yet the price for subscription would be $15 per agent per month, furthermore, utilizing a third-party software such as this would induce the ITRO’s lack of identity as they won’t be able to customize nor carry out their brand along with Asia Pacific College’s.

By weighing down the pros and cons of each option, the team ultimately decided to partner up with the client in order to create a tailor-made ticketing service system that would utilize their brand and identity while still providing the necessary functions to tend to their needs to save their time and finances altogether.

== 7.1 Introduction == 
Towards the start of the project, the team, Nacor Industries has already set a list of scope and limitations that would enable the group to focus on the tasks at hand and not be swayed nor distracted by minor issues nor inconveniences prior, during and after the development phase. This Scope Management Plan aims to identify and elaborate the necessary processes used to define, control, approach, delegate, and verify the project’s scope which involves—but are not limited to—the following:

= 8. COST MANAGEMENT PLAN =

== 8.1 Introduction == 
The purpose of the Cost Management Plan for the Rams Corner Ticketing Service System is to efficiently manage all expenses related to the project from start to finish. The plan establishes guidelines and criteria for measuring, reporting, and regulating the project's costs. 
1. Cost Management Responsibilities
*In addition to overseeing the project's cost management, the Project Manager will collaborate with the project team and stakeholders to establish cost management objectives, develop cost estimates, and monitor and control project expenses to ensure that the project stays within budget. 

2. Cost Change Approval
*The designated authority would review the proposed change and assess its impact on the project's budget, schedule, and overall goals. They would then decide whether to approve or reject the change based on these factors. 
*If the additional cost represents less than 10% of the total project budget, you will need approval from the Project Manager. However, if the cost increase exceeds 10% of the total project budget, you would need to seek approval from the Project Sponsor. 

3. Cost Measurements and Reports
*Cost performance can be quantitatively measured and reported upon by analysing the planned versus actual costs incurred during a project. 
*These reports may include metrics such as Cost Performance Index (CPI) and Schedule Performance Index (SPI), which provide a quantitative assessment of cost and schedule performance, respectively. 

4. Budget Format
*The budget for the project will be presented in a straightforward and easy-to-understand format, using a spreadsheet program such as Excel. The budget will be itemized into individual line items, each with a detailed cost estimate, and updated monthly with any changes clearly marked. 

In essence, the Cost Management Plan devised for the RAMS Corner Ticketing Service System aims to guarantee that every expense related to the project is efficiently handled and regulated, thus enabling the project to be executed within the agreed-upon budget. Such a plan would contribute to the successful and timely completion of the project. 

== 8.2 Cost Management Approach ==
The Cost Management Approach of the RAMS Corner Ticketing Service System will be based upon the following. 
=== Planning ===
*The team will monitor project expenses, regularly report on deviations from the budget, and take corrective action when necessary, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the project's lifecycle. 

=== Cost Estimation ===
*The cost estimate will be regularly updated to reflect any changes in the project's scope or budget and will serve as a baseline against which all project costs will be measured. This will enable the team to track and manage project costs effectively, adjusting as needed to ensure that the project is completed within budget and on schedule. 

=== Budgeting ===
*The budget will serve as a guide for managing project expenses, and it will be regularly monitored and adjusted as necessary to ensure that the project remains on track. The project team will use the budget to prioritize expenditures, allocate resources effectively, and make informed decisions that maximize the value delivered to the community. 

=== Cost Reporting ===
*These reports will be reviewed by project stakeholders to ensure that everyone is aware of the project's financial status and can take appropriate action if necessary. The team will use the reports to identify trends and patterns in project costs, allowing them to adjust their cost management strategies accordingly. In addition, these reports will provide transparency and accountability, ensuring that stakeholders can make informed decisions based on accurate and up-to-date information. 

=== Risk Management ===
*The project team will conduct ongoing risk assessments to identify potential risks that may impact project costs and develop strategies to mitigate these risks. The team will also regularly monitor the effectiveness of these strategies and maintain a risk register to document all identified risks and their corresponding mitigation plans. 

The Cost Management Approach we have devised intends to guarantee that the RAMS Corner Ticketing Service System is executed within the authorized budget, adheres to project objectives, and provides a product of superior quality that caters to the community's requirements. 

== 8.3 Measuring Project Cost ==
Measuring cost performance is a crucial aspect of controlling project costs, and there are several techniques that can be used for this purpose. These techniques include methods such as cost variance, earned value management (EVM), cost performance index, and the Schedule Performance Index.  

Below, we'll provide more information about each of these methods for measuring cost performance. 
=== Cost Variance ===
*Cost variance (CV) is a technique used for measuring the difference between the earned value (EV) and the actual cost (AC) of the work completed. It provides an indication of whether the project is under budget or over budget. CV is calculated by subtracting the actual cost (AC) from the earned value (EV). 

CV = EV - AC 

=== Earned Value Management ===
*Earned Value Management (EVM) is a widely accepted and effective technique for measuring project performance in project management. The technique integrates the three key elements of scope, time, and cost, providing a holistic view of the project's progress and performance. 

(SV) = EV – PV 

=== Cost Performance Index ===
*The CPI provides a measurement of the value of work accomplished in relation to the actual cost of the work completed. It is calculated by dividing the earned value (EV) by the actual cost (AC). 

(CPI) = EV / AC 

=== Schedule Performance Index ===
*The Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is a technique used to measure the project's schedule performance. The SPI provides a measurement of the progress achieved in relation to the work scheduled. It is calculated by dividing the earned value (EV) by the planned value (PV). The SPI value greater than 1 indicates that the project is ahead of schedule, while an SPI value less than 1 indicates that the project is behind schedule. 

(SPI) = EV / PV

== 8.4 Reporting Format ==
The stakeholders will receive a progress report on a weekly basis to update them on the cost status of the project. The report will have a section called "Cost Management" which will provide information on the Earned Value Metrics (EVM), including Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Variance (CV), Schedule Performance Index (SPI), and Cost Performance Index (CPI), for evaluating the project's progress and cost performance. If the project's cost goes beyond the predefined limits, the report will include details of the issue and the corrective actions planned. The report will also monitor change requests resulting from cost overruns to ensure they align with the project budget. These updates will be shared with stakeholders weekly to ensure timely decision-making and maintain transparency. 

== 8.5 Cost Variance Response Process ==
The process for responding to cost variances involves identifying the root causes of the variance, assessing its impact on the project, and developing a plan to address it. First, the project team will investigate the causes of the cost variance, which could be due to changes in scope, resource allocation, or unexpected expenses. Once the causes have been identified, the team will assess the impact of the variance on the project's budget and schedule to determine the severity of the situation. 

Based on this assessment, the team will develop a plan to address the cost variance. This plan may involve cutting costs in other areas of the project, renegotiating contracts with vendors, or requesting additional funding from stakeholders. The plan will be presented to the project sponsor or steering committee for approval before any action is taken. Once the plan has been approved, the team will implement it and monitor its effectiveness to ensure that the project stays on track. 

The Control Thresholds for this project is a CPI or SPI of less than 0.8 or greater than 1.2.  If the project reaches one of these Control Thresholds a Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan is required.  The Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with options for corrective actions within five business days from when the cost variance is first reported.  Within three business days from when the Project Sponsor selects a corrective action option, the Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with a formal Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan.  The Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan will detail the actions necessary to bring the project back within budget and the means by which the effectiveness of the actions in the plan will be measured.  Upon acceptance of the Cost Variance+ Corrective Action Plan it will become a part of the project plan and the project will be updated to reflect the corrective actions.

= 9. Schedule Management Plan =
== 9.1 Introduction ==
The schedule management plan plays a vital role towards the accomplishment and documentation of each task so that the team may be able to work as efficiently as possible. By going through this section, readers can appreciate the approach of the team to finish their project from scratch along with their milestones done within the timeframe of the project and how the team was able to develop the software and thought process whilst developing the project. 
== 9.2 Schedule Management Approach ==
Throughout the project’s lifetime, the team is able to submit all deliverables needed. Each work that was assigned to each member has a specific deadline to help the team estimate how many resources will be needed to finish all the needed tasks before proceeding.  

 

To create the project schedule, the team used software named ‘Project Libre’ to create a Gantt Chart. In this Gantt Chart, all the activities and deliverables are listed and recorded. In this way, it is much easier to monitor the project’s growth over time. 

See reference below of the start and end date of deliverables for project schedule:

One of the benefits of finishing the activities first is that it may reveal changes that are overlooked and need immediate revisions. In this case, this may slow down the progression of the project. When this happens, the team needs to weigh which changes that can have a significant impact. If changes happen, the project adviser is consulted before implementing the changes. In the roles and responsibilities section, you can determine here the scope of work of the people who are assigned to the roles. 

==9.3 Schedule Control==
 Throughout the project lifetime. Updating, deleting, and revising information are bound to happen. Changes within the project are monitored in case the changes are getting slightly off the scope of work. The team would collaborate with the project adviser if the request change were significant to the project.  

 

The project manager will lead the meeting together with the team to discuss the ideas that were added to the equation. The project manager will be managing the schedule of the meetings, updates made within the project, and identifying which tasks are to be done first. 

 

Upon successful compliance, the rest of the team would collaborate to brainstorm and present their ideas since the team’s communication is one of the keys to the success of the project.

==9.4 Schedule Changes and Thresholds==
When developing a project, it is common to have some delays throughout the duration of the project, when the team feels the project will be delayed and it will require more time to finish. Setting a limit or parameter is important so that in case the project is delayed, less resources are to be used to make up for the loss of time.  

 

If the team requests an extension, the project manager should submit a schedule change request. The person who is responsible for approving the request would be the project sponsor. The project sponsor would review the request and have the power to grant the request under his/her authority.  

 

If the change request is approved. The team would then set up a meeting and begin to thoroughly review and examine the adjustments needed for the project. One of the many factors that affect the schedule is poor management skills. This should be addressed so that it will not happen with other future projects to come.  

 

The product owner, product adviser, and project client must have a meeting and discuss which part of the project will be affected by the potential change. It would then be reviewed to gauge how much resources it would require to finish the project, and most importantly, how it will affect the project scope. It is also important to take note that the project schedule will also be affected by the changes. Finding alternatives is also crucial as it may help to resolve the problems. 

==9.5 Scope Changes==
If an issue is overlooked and immediate change is needed. Revising or updating the project scope is the best option there is. Throughout the project's lifetime, changes are inevitable. It is always to be expected that changes might happen from time to time.

=11. HR Management Plan=

==Introduction== 

The staff or team serves as a model for how the project will be led and organized, and it helps to guarantee that the correct individuals, with the necessary credentials, are there at the appropriate time. The strategy includes metrics for performance management as well as roles and responsibilities and communication procedures because the success of the project depends on a solid human resource management plan.

The project manager and project team can successfully manage the project by making sure that everyone on the team is aware of their duties and responsibilities, that communication is clear and efficient, and that performance is tracked and managed in a way that supports the project's success.

==Roles and Responsibilities==

	A project must have a team that has a strategy in place in order to succeed as it clarifies the duties and responsibilities of each member of the project team and the client, and to make sure that everyone in the team is aware of their own contributions.

To ensure that resources are distributed and used efficiently, the plan guarantees that the appropriate individuals are in the appropriate roles to accomplish project successfully by explicitly identifying competences and skill needs.

Overall, the project team is guided toward effective project execution and delivery by the human resources management strategy, which serves as a road map.

=13. Procurement Management Plan=
==13.1 Introduction ==
The procurement management plan plays a vital role in the making of RAMS’ Corner: Ticketing service system. It serves as a guide and outlines to make all the things needed to make the software run smoothly. It will justify why using up to date technologies are needed. The procurement management plan will be revised or updated from time to time in case there has been a change in obtaining the necessary materials. Along with this paper, it will also include all the possible risks and will layout its mitigation plan, different types of contracts that will be used, and cost determination. 

 

The procurement management plan outlines all the critical scenarios that are relevant to make the project successful. It will help align all the necessary deliverables to avoid delaying things and keep them on track. 

==13.2 Procurement Risk ==
All activities have their own risks. This includes procuring all the materials needed, goods, or any services that would be vital in making the project successful 

The Nacor industries should plan out ahead on how to avoid or mitigate the damage a possible risk can cause. The team identified all the possible scenarios that should be considered when procuring all the necessary materials. The list below shows all the possible angles that can happen but not limited to:   

1. Failure to deliver all the materials within the project timeline causing delays and higher cost of budget. 

2. Receiving not properly integrated hardware causing resulting in frequent maintenance and poor customer service. 

3. Incorrect or lack of research about certain products which may lead into buying wrong materials which can also cause to increase budget. 

4. Having a contract with a vendor that doesn’t meet the industry standard which may impact not only the project’s reputation, but also the company. 

5. having a poor communication between the team and the vendor acquiring more than enough resources which can cause higher cost of budget without fully utilizing all the materials bought.  

 

This part of the paper is simultaneously updated to keep track of the updated possible risks that can have an impact on the project. This will be updated from time to time throughout the project’s lifetime to ensure quality output when launching the finished project. 

==13.3 Procurement Risk Management==
1. Identification of procurement risks 

For the company to plan out and mitigate the risk. The company should first the risk. The possible procurement management risk for the Nacor industries is below but not limited to: 

Delayed delivery of materials 

Having sub-standard materials 

Lack of materials coming from the same vendor 

Sudden inflation of materials causing higher costs 

 

                  2. Risk mitigation strategies
