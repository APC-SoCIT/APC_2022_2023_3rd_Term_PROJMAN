APC, being an IT focused school, has a need for a unit/department/group who would take care of IT equipment and get it ready for classes.  The group "prepared" the IT equipment in the back office without needing to involve the students and the faculty.  The objective was to keep the IT facilities ready for use during classes and practically anytime needed.

ITRO mainly maintains IT-involved equipment, so knowing how computers work was very important. The same is true in making sure software was always updated, which includes license management and maintaining software compatibility. The ITRO also plays a crucial role in managing costs, making sure the software gets appropriate hardware support to run it. 

ITRO mainly maintains IT-involved equipment, so knowing how computers work was very important. The same is true in making sure software was always updated, which includes license management and maintaining software compatibility. The ITRO also plays a crucial role in managing costs, making sure the software gets appropriate hardware support to run it. 

Aside from these main tasks for ITRO, here are also some of the specific works that is managed by this department: 
:-	APC Portal handling 
:-	ID making
:-	Network ITRO Administration 
:-	ITRO Administrative technological issues
:-	Computer hardware issues
:-	Computer laboratories issues
:-	Cloud laboratories
:-	Software Development and maintenance

Now burdened with the task of being the go-to of everyone needing IT-related queries and maintenance services, Mr. Castillo, along with the rest of the ITRO, has a huge role in the implementation of Flexible Learning in APC. Especially now, (March 2022) that the personnel are limited to just himself, as he referred to himself as a “one-man army” with little-to-no assistants to back him up, the office has been very much busy to the point that they could no longer reply to emails and requests from teachers and students needing their expertise. With the staggering number of requests, they have been pending for the past few months even before the pandemic, and with the limited workforce available, it is no surprise that they are really in need of something to at least make their work more convenient and efficient.

In summary, the ITRO is the team who makes sure APC's mission/vision statements and plans are achieved.

'''Project: RAMS Corner – ITRO Ticketing Service System'''
For the betterment of the ITRO and the whole school as well the team offers to create a web-based application that would make use of ticketing method similar to that of Discord and other outsourcing companies—to be used on any browser accessible through a desktop computer or a laptop—that would not only help the students and teachers get an equal chance to be given audience by the ITRO, but also to provide automated answers to frequently-asked-questions through a dedicated Knowledge Base that would be done by asking the ITRO about their clients’ commonly-asked questions before the development phase. This will make self-troubleshooting easier and much more convenient. Furthermore, the ITRO as Admins could set the prioritization for certain emails based on how they see it in terms of urgency. This way, those who need urgent help would not find themselves lost waiting for a reply with their hardware/software issues left unattended. The goal is to have the system run smoothly with all functions intact, during the early development stages, until fully rolling it out after polishing the prototype that would be approved. So that at least two or three people from each classroom could report immediately to the ITRO if they happen to need assistance.

= 4. BUSINESS CASE = 

== 4.1 Problem Definition ==
=== 4.1.1 Problem Statement ===
The Asia Pacific College ITRO Department lacks a system that would help them address the school’s technical-related problems. They only use email system which oftentimes. ITRO personnel tend to miss out on the students, teachers, or staff emails regarding the problem they encountered. This might lead to a bigger problem since there are problems that need attention and action.

=== 4.1.2 Organizational Impact ===
The Nacor Industries’ RAMS Corner: ITRO Ticketing Service System will make a significant change in the ITRO Department. Some of the changes that will immediately take effect is the current system that they are using.
'''Tools:'''
Once the RAMS Corner: ITRO Ticketing Service System is up and running. It will replace the old email system that the Department is currently using. This will require training for the ITRO personnel because the software is new and fresh. The training will provide much smoother work as they will navigate each button and functions continuously and they won’t need to guess the functions of a specific button.

'''Processes'''
The new system made will boost the ITRO’s productivity as the system will ask its users for full details of the problem they encountered. This will reduce the time of the personnel trying to figure out what the users are trying to convey. It will reduce the manual assigning of tickets as the system will automatically assign personnel to resolve the problem. 

'''Roles and Responsibilities:'''
The department is divided into two groups. One that handles all hardware-related problems and another for all software-related problems. With the new system, all the ITRO personnel can focus on the fields of their expertise. In this way, the job gets to be done in a short time as the personnel who handle the problem know what they are doing resulting in a smooth resolution for the users.

'''Hardware and Software:'''
The department is divided into two groups. One that handles all hardware-related problems and another for all software-related problems. With the new system, all the ITRO personnel can focus on the fields of their expertise. In this way, the job gets to be done in a short time as the personnel who handle the problem know what they are doing resulting in a smooth resolution for the users.

=== 4.1.3 Technology Migration ===

Phase 1:
*The development team would pull a handful of the existing accounts within the project stakeholders through their APC outlook emails for isolated testing purposes.

Phase 2:
*If the test cases were all satisfactory, then the backend developer would proceed to pull all existing accounts and build their own accounts with pre-determined credentials to be modified later by each of the stakeholders and fill the Knowledge Base with past issues raised and solved by the ITRO.

Phase 3:
*With the acknowledgement of the ITRO Head, Mr. Jojo Castillo, the ITRO are encouraged to promote the newly developed web-application by informing their clients of its existence through pre-established communication channels such as their APC emails or through a formal press release.

Phase 4:
*With the acknowledgement of the ITRO Head, Mr. Jojo Castillo, the ITRO are encouraged to promote the newly developed web-application by informing their clients of its existence through pre-established communication channels such as their APC emails or through a formal press release.

== 4.2 Project Overview ==
=== 4.2.1 Project Description ===
RAMS Corner Ticketing System is a web-based application that would make use of a ticketing method similar to that of Discord and other outsourcing companies that would not only help the students and teachers get an equal chance to be given audience by the ITRO, but also to provide automated questions to frequently-asked-questions through a dedicated knowledge base that would be done by surveying them before the development phase. Making troubleshooting easier and much more convenient.

= 4.3 Strategic Alignment =
A. The ITRO follows the following mission and objectives for each of the ITRO sub-department:
: '''Objectives of the Infrastructure Team:'''
#Provide IT hardware, cloud services, technical support services, where and when needed by the members of the APC Communality
#Maintain the equipment ready for use by everyone.
: '''Objectives of the Development Team:'''
#Develop software needed by the organization for its efficient operations.
#Maintain these applications to go with the times including any process changes.

B. External environment analysis:
:-Mostly, it is the growing trend and increase in volume of the demand for cloud-based technologies.

C. Internal resources and capabilities analysis:
:-People: ITRO only has a few staff. These staff are highly skilled in terms of technology handling.
:-Process: Follows specific receive-process-deliver steps in completing a request/solving a problem. No data gathering tools are used for better decision-making. 
:-Technology: Equipped with latest technology tools

D. Strategic goals
:-Launch an app that is specifically used to manage the problems and inquiries of APC Community
:-Lower the requests/inquiries that are frequently asked to the ITRO by 10% very year 
:-Increase the percentage of the people who are accommodated by 20% within a year
:-Keep track of the interaction between ITRO and its clients as a basis for decision-making and for record-keeping 

E. Strategic plan
:-Develop a web application that is accessible both in desktop, laptop, or smartphone, with or without connectivity issues, with an uptime of 95% a year
:-Include a library for solutions as a feature of the web app to lower the percentage of receiving redundant request
:-Create Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the problems/request raised to the ITRO according to its impact and severity to an individual, a group of individuals or the whole APC Community
:-Data analytics 

By following this strategic alignment, the ITRO can leverage or improve its internal resources and capabilities to be able to manage the external environment issues and achieve the objectives of their department whilst retaining their success in providing service for the APC Community in the following years.

= 4.4 Cost Benefit Analysis =
The cost and benefits section will provide an overview of the analysis of the expenditure versus the benefits that the ITRO can incur from the RAMS Corner: ITRO Ticketing Service System Project. The expected primary benefits will include work efficiency, transparency, accountability, and improved customer service.

Listed below are the identified specific intangible benefits that the ITRO can gain from this project:

*Efficient Issue Management: RAMS Corner will allow the users to submit their issues or requests, and the ITRO Staff can prioritize and address them accordingly. This ensures that all requests are properly attended to in a timely manner.

*Streamlined Communication: RAMS Corner will have centralized communication between the APC Residents and the ITRO. Clients can submit tickets with detailed information about their issues, and ITRO Staff can respond and provide updates within the system. This eliminates the need for back-and-forth emails or phone calls (in which they are currently using), making communication more streamlined and reducing the chances of miscommunication.

*Accountability and Transparency: Using the report generation of RAMS Corner, it will become easier to track the progress of each request, be it by the status, prioritization, or the person assigned to the ticket. The system records all actions taken on a ticket, including who is working on it and when updates were made. This improves accountability within the ITRO and allows ITRO Head to have a clear overview of the team's workload and performance.

*Efficient Problem Resolution: By having an automated categorization and prioritization of issues based on their severity or impact, the ITRO can set service level agreements (SLAs) for different types of tickets, ensuring that critical issues are resolved immediately. This helps in managing resources efficiently and ensures that IT Staffs can focus on resolving issues effectively.

*Knowledge Base Creation: Over time, from the ITRO’s current system (the email-based), ITRO has accumulated a wealth of information about common IT problems raised by APC Residents as well as their solutions. This can become a foundation for the knowledge base that can be used to create a library of self-troubleshooting articles or FAQs, which can be made available to both the ITRO and their clients as a resource for troubleshooting common issues. This reduces the workload on ITRO staff and empowers users to find answers to their queries independently.

*Data-driven Insights: By using the data analytics collected within the RAMS Corner, the ITRO Head can gain insights as to what are the recurring issues, service trends, and resource requirements. This information can be used to identify areas for improvement, optimize allocation of resources, and make data-driven decisions for enhancing the ITRO Services.

*Customer Satisfaction: RAMS Corner enhances customer satisfaction by providing an efficient customer support experience. Clients receive timely updates on the progress of their tickets, and ITRO Staff can provide better support by having access to complete ticket histories, knowledge base, and related information. This will allow them to resolve issues faster and more effectively that leads to improved customer satisfaction.

On the other hand, listed below are the expected cost that the development of RAMS Corner will incur from the ITRO:

*Planning, analysis and design, development, and implementation cost is approximately PHP 870,397.58
*During the testing phase, the team will need hosting services, which will cost PHP 3,948.00. Although this can be lowered or removed if the ITRO will use in-house servers in the actual deployment

RAMS Corner Ticketing System, and the team of developers behind it: Nacor Industries would be working for 21 months within the specific budget allotted for the project—RAMS Corner: Ticketing Service System as referenced in the table below:

<img src="https://github.com/apcjlquesada/APC_2022_2023_T3_PROJMAN_MI201_MI203_G04_Nacor_Industries/blob/50b0f60bccf701931679ec0a16bbaac36280bd2d/wikihub%20photos/image_2023-06-24_233548011.png?raw=true" alt="Image description" style="display:center; margin:0 auto;">

Within the entirety of the timespan attributed to the development of the project, it is important to note that the only expenses that the client—APC-ITRO—would consider will only be the salaries for each member, along with the hosting and security expenses, and the depreciation expenses. Utilities and devices used will be made from the project team’s own devices, and the work environment will be from their own homes, if not within the premises of Asia Pacific College, making it more cost-effective and beneficial for the client as opposed to hiring other professionals nor subscribing to pre-existing services available online.

== 5.7 Project Approvals Requirements ==
RAMS Corner Ticketing System’s success will be achieved when fully fleshed-out software is published and is installed within the devices of the ITRO Office and their clientele within the time and cost constraints indicated in this charter. To further assess the success of the project, post-deployment surveys would be done in order to gauge the effectivity of the solution, along with any other possible recommendations or suggestions that might be useful for the betterment of the system which would be determined by the Project’s Beneficiary, Mr. Jojo Castillo, the ITRO Head, who will authorize the completion of the project.

= 6. Project Management Approach = 
The Project Sponsor is the one responsible for the initiation and the funding of the whole project. Meanwhile, the responsibility of the Project Manager is the overall planning, execution, and project delivery, all according to how the project should run based on the Project Management Plan. The Scrum Master will be the one to facilitate the execution of the Agile methodology used in the Project Lifecycle. Lastly, the documentation team is the group responsible for maintaining the project documentation – which includes the meeting minutes, plans, technical documentation, and any other relevant records. 
Documentation Team, together with the Project Sponsor, Project Manager, and Scrum Master must ensure that all documentation is up to date, organized, and accessible by all the Stakeholders. Any changes, updates, and approvals should be included in the writings and be signed mainly by the Project Sponsor and Project Manager.

== 7.1 Product Development Methodology ==
== 5.2 Technical Architecture == 

= 8. COST MANAGEMENT PLAN =

== 8.1 Introduction == 
The purpose of the Cost Management Plan for the Rams Corner Ticketing Service System is to efficiently manage all expenses related to the project from start to finish. The plan establishes guidelines and criteria for measuring, reporting, and regulating the project's costs. 
1. Cost Management Responsibilities
*In addition to overseeing the project's cost management, the Project Manager will collaborate with the project team and stakeholders to establish cost management objectives, develop cost estimates, and monitor and control project expenses to ensure that the project stays within budget. 

2. Cost Change Approval
*The designated authority would review the proposed change and assess its impact on the project's budget, schedule, and overall goals. They would then decide whether to approve or reject the change based on these factors. 
*If the additional cost represents less than 10% of the total project budget, you will need approval from the Project Manager. However, if the cost increase exceeds 10% of the total project budget, you would need to seek approval from the Project Sponsor. 

3. Cost Measurements and Reports
*Cost performance can be quantitatively measured and reported upon by analysing the planned versus actual costs incurred during a project. 
*These reports may include metrics such as Cost Performance Index (CPI) and Schedule Performance Index (SPI), which provide a quantitative assessment of cost and schedule performance, respectively. 

4. Budget Format
*The budget for the project will be presented in a straightforward and easy-to-understand format, using a spreadsheet program such as Excel. The budget will be itemized into individual line items, each with a detailed cost estimate, and updated monthly with any changes clearly marked. 

In essence, the Cost Management Plan devised for the RAMS Corner Ticketing Service System aims to guarantee that every expense related to the project is efficiently handled and regulated, thus enabling the project to be executed within the agreed-upon budget. Such a plan would contribute to the successful and timely completion of the project. 

== 8.2 Cost Management Approach ==
The Cost Management Approach of the RAMS Corner Ticketing Service System will be based upon the following. 
=== Planning ===
*The team will monitor project expenses, regularly report on deviations from the budget, and take corrective action when necessary, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the project's lifecycle. 

=== Cost Estimation ===
*The cost estimate will be regularly updated to reflect any changes in the project's scope or budget and will serve as a baseline against which all project costs will be measured. This will enable the team to track and manage project costs effectively, adjusting as needed to ensure that the project is completed within budget and on schedule. 

=== Budgeting ===
*The budget will serve as a guide for managing project expenses, and it will be regularly monitored and adjusted as necessary to ensure that the project remains on track. The project team will use the budget to prioritize expenditures, allocate resources effectively, and make informed decisions that maximize the value delivered to the community. 

=== Cost Reporting ===
*These reports will be reviewed by project stakeholders to ensure that everyone is aware of the project's financial status and can take appropriate action if necessary. The team will use the reports to identify trends and patterns in project costs, allowing them to adjust their cost management strategies accordingly. In addition, these reports will provide transparency and accountability, ensuring that stakeholders can make informed decisions based on accurate and up-to-date information. 

=== Risk Management ===
*The project team will conduct ongoing risk assessments to identify potential risks that may impact project costs and develop strategies to mitigate these risks. The team will also regularly monitor the effectiveness of these strategies and maintain a risk register to document all identified risks and their corresponding mitigation plans. 

The Cost Management Approach we have devised intends to guarantee that the RAMS Corner Ticketing Service System is executed within the authorized budget, adheres to project objectives, and provides a product of superior quality that caters to the community's requirements. 

== 8.3 Measuring Project Cost ==
Measuring cost performance is a crucial aspect of controlling project costs, and there are several techniques that can be used for this purpose. These techniques include methods such as cost variance, earned value management (EVM), cost performance index, and the Schedule Performance Index.  

Below, we'll provide more information about each of these methods for measuring cost performance. 
=== Cost Variance ===
*Cost variance (CV) is a technique used for measuring the difference between the earned value (EV) and the actual cost (AC) of the work completed. It provides an indication of whether the project is under budget or over budget. CV is calculated by subtracting the actual cost (AC) from the earned value (EV). 

CV = EV - AC 

=== Earned Value Management ===
*Earned Value Management (EVM) is a widely accepted and effective technique for measuring project performance in project management. The technique integrates the three key elements of scope, time, and cost, providing a holistic view of the project's progress and performance. 

(SV) = EV – PV 

=== Cost Performance Index ===
*The CPI provides a measurement of the value of work accomplished in relation to the actual cost of the work completed. It is calculated by dividing the earned value (EV) by the actual cost (AC). 

(CPI) = EV / AC 

=== Schedule Performance Index ===
*The Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is a technique used to measure the project's schedule performance. The SPI provides a measurement of the progress achieved in relation to the work scheduled. It is calculated by dividing the earned value (EV) by the planned value (PV). The SPI value greater than 1 indicates that the project is ahead of schedule, while an SPI value less than 1 indicates that the project is behind schedule. 

(SPI) = EV / PV

== 8.4 Reporting Format ==
The stakeholders will receive a progress report on a weekly basis to update them on the cost status of the project. The report will have a section called "Cost Management" which will provide information on the Earned Value Metrics (EVM), including Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Variance (CV), Schedule Performance Index (SPI), and Cost Performance Index (CPI), for evaluating the project's progress and cost performance. If the project's cost goes beyond the predefined limits, the report will include details of the issue and the corrective actions planned. The report will also monitor change requests resulting from cost overruns to ensure they align with the project budget. These updates will be shared with stakeholders weekly to ensure timely decision-making and maintain transparency. 

== 8.5 Cost Variance Response Process ==
The process for responding to cost variances involves identifying the root causes of the variance, assessing its impact on the project, and developing a plan to address it. First, the project team will investigate the causes of the cost variance, which could be due to changes in scope, resource allocation, or unexpected expenses. Once the causes have been identified, the team will assess the impact of the variance on the project's budget and schedule to determine the severity of the situation. 

Based on this assessment, the team will develop a plan to address the cost variance. This plan may involve cutting costs in other areas of the project, renegotiating contracts with vendors, or requesting additional funding from stakeholders. The plan will be presented to the project sponsor or steering committee for approval before any action is taken. Once the plan has been approved, the team will implement it and monitor its effectiveness to ensure that the project stays on track. 

The Control Thresholds for this project is a CPI or SPI of less than 0.8 or greater than 1.2.  If the project reaches one of these Control Thresholds a Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan is required.  The Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with options for corrective actions within five business days from when the cost variance is first reported.  Within three business days from when the Project Sponsor selects a corrective action option, the Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with a formal Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan.  The Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan will detail the actions necessary to bring the project back within budget and the means by which the effectiveness of the actions in the plan will be measured.  Upon acceptance of the Cost Variance+ Corrective Action Plan it will become a part of the project plan and the project will be updated to reflect the corrective actions.

= 9. Schedule Management Plan =
== 9.1 Introduction ==
The schedule management plan plays a vital role towards the accomplishment and documentation of each task so that the team may be able to work as efficiently as possible. By going through this section, readers can appreciate the approach of the team to finish their project from scratch along with their milestones done within the timeframe of the project and how the team was able to develop the software and thought process whilst developing the project. 
== 9.2 Schedule Management Approach ==
Throughout the project’s lifetime, the team is able to submit all deliverables needed. Each work that was assigned to each member has a specific deadline to help the team estimate how many resources will be needed to finish all the needed tasks before proceeding.  

To create the project schedule, the team used software named ‘Project Libre’ to create a Gantt Chart. In this Gantt Chart, all the activities and deliverables are listed and recorded. In this way, it is much easier to monitor the project’s growth over time. 

See reference below of the start and end date of deliverables for project schedule:

One of the benefits of finishing the activities first is that it may reveal changes that are overlooked and need immediate revisions. In this case, this may slow down the progression of the project. When this happens, the team needs to weigh which changes that can have a significant impact. If changes happen, the project adviser is consulted before implementing the changes. In the roles and responsibilities section, you can determine here the scope of work of the people who are assigned to the roles. 

==9.3 Schedule Control==
Throughout the project lifetime. Updating, deleting, and revising information are bound to happen. Changes within the project are monitored in case the changes are getting slightly off the scope of work. The team would collaborate with the project adviser if the request change were significant to the project.  

The project manager will lead the meeting together with the team to discuss the ideas that were added to the equation. The project manager will be managing the schedule of the meetings, updates made within the project, and identifying which tasks are to be done first. 

Upon successful compliance, the rest of the team would collaborate to brainstorm and present their ideas since the team’s communication is one of the keys to the success of the project.

==9.4 Schedule Changes and Thresholds==
When developing a project, it is common to have some delays throughout the duration of the project, when the team feels the project will be delayed and it will require more time to finish. Setting a limit or parameter is important so that in case the project is delayed, less resources are to be used to make up for the loss of time.  

If the team requests an extension, the project manager should submit a schedule change request. The person who is responsible for approving the request would be the project sponsor. The project sponsor would review the request and have the power to grant the request under his/her authority.  

If the change request is approved. The team would then set up a meeting and begin to thoroughly review and examine the adjustments needed for the project. One of the many factors that affect the schedule is poor management skills. This should be addressed so that it will not happen with other future projects to come.  

The product owner, product adviser, and project client must have a meeting and discuss which part of the project will be affected by the potential change. It would then be reviewed to gauge how much resources it would require to finish the project, and most importantly, how it will affect the project scope. It is also important to take note that the project schedule will also be affected by the changes. Finding alternatives is also crucial as it may help to resolve the problems. 

==9.5 Scope Changes==
If an issue is overlooked and immediate change is needed. Revising or updating the project scope is the best option there is. Throughout the project's lifetime, changes are inevitable. It is always to be expected that changes might happen from time to time.
