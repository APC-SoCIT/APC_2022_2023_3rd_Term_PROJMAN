<h2> Work Breakdown Structure </h2>

<p>The project team will utilize the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to create a detailed view of the project scope by breaking it down into smaller components. Each level of the WBS will represent a progressively more detailed view of the project, which will assist in assigning responsibilities to team members and tracking progress. The WBS Dictionary will provide detailed information about each component in the WBS, including the scope of work, deliverables, responsibilities, and any other relevant information. The WBS and WBS Dictionary will be crucial in managing the project scope, ensuring that all aspects of the project are accounted for, and that the project stays on track and within scope. </p>

<h2>Work Performance Measurements</h2>
<p>These performance metrics will be used to monitor the website development project for Fleeky Curtains and make sure it is finished on schedule, within budget, and to the satisfaction of the client. Following these metrics throughout the project will enable Fleeky Curtains to see areas where they are succeeding and those where they might need to make improvements, which will eventually result in a successful project and pleased clients.</p>
