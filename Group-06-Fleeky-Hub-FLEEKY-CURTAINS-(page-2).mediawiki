</li>

</ol>


<h2>Scope Management Approach</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Authority and responsibility for scope management will be held by the Project Manager, Pallas Fontiveros, who will work closely with the Project Sponsor, Ms. Mitzi Garcia, and other key stakeholders to define and manage the scope of the project. 
</li>
<li>
To determine the scope of the project, a Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, and a comprehensive Statement of Work (SOW) will be developed. These documents will precisely specify the project's objectives, activities, and prerequisites, and will undergo evaluation and endorsement by the project sponsor and other involved parties prior to commencing the work. 
</li>
<li>
The project's extent will be evaluated and confirmed using quality checklists, measurements of work performance, and regular monitoring of the project's advancement in relation to the original scope. If there are any discrepancies from the initial scope, they will be identified and dealt with using the scope change process. 
</li>
<li>
The Fleeky Hub project's procedure for modifying its scope will entail the Project Manager submitting a request for scope change, which will then be approved by the project sponsor. It is crucial to thoroughly assess any alterations to the project's scope to ensure that they are consistent with the project's objectives and do not have a detrimental impact on the project schedule or budget. 
</li>
<li>
The project manager will ensure that all project requirements are met and that the project sponsor and other important stakeholders approve and accept the final project deliverables. The project will be considered successfully completed only after all deliverables have been accepted and any remaining issues have been addressed. 
</li>
</ol>
