<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><em><b>Scope Definition: </em></b>The scope of the Fleeky Hub will be defined through the following activities:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Requirements gathering:</b>  The team will meet with the client to identify the business needs and problems. A project timeline will be established to create a survey for the client, which will focus on the client's business process, specifically related to e-commerce websites. Additionally, the survey will include questions about the status of the client’s employees’ tasks and process. 
</li>
<li>
<b>User stories:</b> After gathering the set of requirements, the team will provide a set of user stories for the end-users, defining the functionality of the client's e-commerce website (Fleeky Hub). The team will organize the user stories hierarchically based on their priority and execute them accordingly. The user stories will guide the development process for the developers. 
</li>
<li>
<b>Scope statement: </b>The project scope statement will be based on the user stories created by the team, which will serve as the requirements for the project. The project manager will provide the team with deadlines for each iteration to ensure that the requirements are achieved within the given timeframe. 
</li>
<li>
<b>Scope base: </b>The project scope baseline provides the team's scope statement and user stories as a feasible management plan. The team will provide daily and weekly updates on the project's progress, allowing for ongoing review of the scope statement to identify any necessary changes. 
</li>
</ol>

<p><em><b>Scope Documentation: </em></b>The scope of the Fleeky Hub e-commerce website will be documented in the following ways: </p>

<ol>

</li>
<li>
<b>Change log: </b> A change log will track the development and project plan, documenting any changes made to the project scope, including the description of the change, its impact on the project, and any required approvals. 
</li>
</ol>

<p><em><b>Scope Control:</b> </em>The scope of the Fleeky Hub e-commerce website will be controlled through the following activities: </p>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Scope verification: </b>The project team will use agile testing and waterfall techniques to verify that the deliverable of the project meets the requirements and align with the scope statement that can fully utilize the project implementation every iteration. 
</li>
<li>
<b>Scope change control: </b> Any changes to the scope of the project will be managed through a formal change control process, which will include an assessment of the impact on the project schedule, budget, and quality. 
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>


<h2>Scope Management Approach</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Authority and responsibility for scope management will be held by the Project Manager, Pallas Fontiveros, who will work closely with the Project Sponsor, Ms. Mitzi Garcia, and other key stakeholders to define and manage the scope of the project. 
</li>
<li>
To determine the scope of the project, a Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, and a comprehensive Statement of Work (SOW) will be developed. These documents will precisely specify the project's objectives, activities, and prerequisites, and will undergo evaluation and endorsement by the project sponsor and other involved parties prior to commencing the work. 
</li>
<li>
The project's extent will be evaluated and confirmed using quality checklists, measurements of work performance, and regular monitoring of the project's advancement in relation to the original scope. If there are any discrepancies from the initial scope, they will be identified and dealt with using the scope change process. 
</li>
<li>
The Fleeky Hub project's procedure for modifying its scope will entail the Project Manager submitting a request for scope change, which will then be approved by the project sponsor. It is crucial to thoroughly assess any alterations to the project's scope to ensure that they are consistent with the project's objectives and do not have a detrimental impact on the project schedule or budget. 
</li>
<li>
The project manager will ensure that all project requirements are met and that the project sponsor and other important stakeholders approve and accept the final project deliverables. The project will be considered successfully completed only after all deliverables have been accepted and any remaining issues have been addressed. 
</li>
</ol>
