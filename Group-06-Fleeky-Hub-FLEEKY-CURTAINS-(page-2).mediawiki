<h2>Stakeholders Identification</h2>

<p>The project team may use the Brainstorming methodology to uncover potential stakeholders that may not be identified right away. This could be done through creating a list of potential stakeholders and conducting group discussion and brainstorming within the project team. In the stakeholder identification process, the project team may ask the possible participants there may be when it comes to their relevance and significance to the business and project so the team will be able to have their approval and support that may help the project development succeed and be able to avoid hindrance or blockage to its progress.</p><p> When identifying the stakeholders, depending on their amount of influence, interest, and involvement in the project or organization, the stakeholders can be divided into several categories. For reference, key stakeholders for the project may be those directly impacted by the project or organization, such as clients or staff, whereas secondary stakeholders are those impacted indirectly, such as vendors or regulatory bodies. Other stakeholder groups can include internal stakeholders, external stakeholders, and key stakeholders, who tend to have a substantial influence on the organization's or project's success.</p><p> With identifying the stakeholders, for the project team to ensure that their interests and concerns are taken into consideration during the decision-making process and to increase support for the project or organization, stakeholders must be identified and engaged with. The chances of success can be increased, and trust can be gained while lowering resistance to change.</p>

<h2>Key Stakeholders</h2>

The team will organize the user stories hierarchically based on their priority and execute them accordingly. The user stories will guide the development process for the developers. 
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>

<p><em><b>Scope Documentation: </em></b>The scope of the Fleeky Hub e-commerce website will be documented in the following ways: </p>

<h2>Scope Management Approach</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Authority and responsibility for scope management will be held by the Project Manager, Pallas Fontiveros, who will work closely with the Project Sponsor, Ms. Mitzi Garcia, and other key stakeholders to define and manage the scope of the project. 
</li>
<li>
To determine the scope of the project, a Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, and a comprehensive Statement of Work (SOW) will be developed. These documents will precisely specify the project's objectives, activities, and prerequisites, and will undergo evaluation and endorsement by the project sponsor and other involved parties prior to commencing the work. 
</li>
<li>
The project's extent will be evaluated and confirmed using quality checklists, measurements of work performance, and regular monitoring of the project's advancement in relation to the original scope. If there are any discrepancies from the initial scope, they will be identified and dealt with using the scope change process. 
</li>
<li>

It is crucial to thoroughly assess any alterations to the project's scope to ensure that they are consistent with the project's objectives and do not have a detrimental impact on the project schedule or budget. 
</li>
<li>
The project manager will ensure that all project requirements are met and that the project sponsor and other important stakeholders approve and accept the final project deliverables. The project will be considered successfully completed only after all deliverables have been accepted and any remaining issues have been addressed. 
</li>
</ol>
