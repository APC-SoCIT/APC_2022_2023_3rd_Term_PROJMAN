=Business Case=
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Fleeky Hub is a Local online retailer of curtains and draperies. By offering a wide selection of curtain colors, materials,  and  styles  at  an  affordable  price,  we  aim  to  provide  our  clients  with  an  easy  and  simple purchasing experience. The project proposed will be simple to use and offer each consumer a stress-free buying experience.</p><p>Fleeky Hub's business strategy is based on an online shopping platform such as Shopee, which has seen drastic growth in recent years due to most of businesses transitioning to an online platform as well as the demand  for  online  purchasing.  Online  shopping  has  seen  a  significant  trend  due  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing this upward trend, Fleeky Hub gives clients the ability of purchasing their curtains from the convenience of the clients' respective homes. Our web shop is available 24/7, allowing customers to shop at their convenience. </p>

<h2>Issue</h2>

<p>There were  multiple  issues  that arose  during  the  pandemic  and  post  pandemic  on  the business of Fleeky Curtains, since the employees of the business are all members of the family there are times when some of them have different schedules and personal agendas due to some them are still studying, and this has been a pain point in their business since when there  is  a depletion  in  terms  of  the  staff  the processing  of  orders  and  customer services  would  be  gravely  affected.  Another  problem  of Fleeky Curtains  was  the processing the  clients'  orders,  since they  are using  a  traditional  method  of  manually encoding order information to the system, which becomes a problem since the processing of customer information becomes redundant and time consuming.</p>

<h2>Anticipated Outcomes</h2>

<p>The  outcome  of  the  project  will  help  them open their  market  to  different channels. Having their own domain and their site will lose their dependency to other e-commerce sites which was also stated that they are having challenges in terms of their commission rates as per customer purchase at the e-commerce site. With the help of the project, it will lessen the costs of the business and stabilize production and growth of the sales. This will also be a place to lead the customer in purchasing their likes and needs.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

<p>Add feature that guests customers can also make their purchases at the site rather than creating an account in the first place. It would be better also to add a friendly viewing experience when it is accessed via mobile phone. </p><p>Fleeky Hub's features and functionalities streamline various tasks, automate repetitive processes,  and  provide  tools  for  efficient  management  of  tasks  and  workflows.  As  a result, employees can complete their tasks faster and with increased accuracy, leading to improved productivity and reduced processing time. </p><p>Furthermore,  the  integration  of  Fleeky  Hub  allows  for  the  digitalization  of  manual processes.  The  platform  enables  the  automation  of  tasks  that  were  previously  done manually, such as data entry, scheduling, and reporting. This not only eliminates the risk of errors associated with manual processes but also increases the overall efficiency and accuracy of the operations. The digitalization of processes also enables real-time tracking and  monitoring  of  tasks,  providing  managers  with  better  visibility  and  control  over operations. </p><p>In  addition,  Fleeky  Hub  offers  a  wide  range  of  features  that  can  help  create  a  better working environment for the client's employees. For example, it provides collaboration tools that facilitate communication and coordination among team members, helping to streamline workflows and improve overall team productivity. It also offers reporting and analytics features that provide insights into team performance and allow for data-driven decision   making.   These   features   can   lead   to   a   more   organized,   efficient,   and collaborative working environment for the employees, enhancing their job satisfaction and overall well-being.</p>

<h2>Justification</h2>

<p>Not only the group will provide the platform to its client to help its daily operations, but also to establish a means where the client’s business can invite or encourage other potential  customers  in patronizing their product and  even have the potential  to touch other markets that they previously do not reach for a greater yield. </p><p>As local stores leverage several types of software, social media, and modern technologies to  market  their  products,  integrating  Fleeky  Hub  can  be  the  most  effective  approach. This will centralize the web marketing process for Fleeky Curtains, while also providing an  opportunity  to  utilize  the  features  integrated  by  Fleeky  Hub  to  monitor  customer behavior towards their products. Such monitoring will aid Fleeky Curtains in identifying profitable products and making informed decisions about their production strategy. </p><p>By  integrating  Fleeky  Hub  into  their  marketing  efforts,  Fleeky  Curtains  can  streamline and optimize their online marketing processes. The platform offers a range of features that  can  help  manage  and  track  marketing  campaigns,  analyze  customer  data, and provide valuable insights into customer behavior. This information can be utilized to gain a  deeper  understanding  of  customer  preferences,  purchasing  patterns,  and  product performance. </p><p>With  these  insights,  Fleeky  Curtains  can  make  data-driven  decisions  to  optimize  their production  strategy.  They  can  identify  which  products  are  performing  well  and  adjust their  production  schedule  accordingly.  For  instance,  if  certain  products  are  in  high demand,  Fleeky  Curtains  can  allocate  more  resources  to  produce  them  and  ensure sufficient  stock  is  available.  On  the  other hand, if  certain  products  are  not  performing well, production can be adjusted or discontinued to avoid excess inventory</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>With family members often occupied with their own commitments at work, school, or home, managing a business can become challenging in terms of time management.</p><p> Running  a  business  requires considerable  time and  effort,  including  tasks  such  as marketing,  operations,  finance,  and  customer  management.  However,  when  family members have their own individual responsibilities and schedules to attend to, it can be challenging  to  allocate  sufficient  time  to  the  business.  Competing  priorities  and  busy schedules  may  result  in  limited  availability  to  focus  on  the  business  and  its  various aspects.</p>
<p>Having a limited number of employees means they are bound to achieve less activities:</p>

<p>1. Delayed response to customer inquiries that frequently asks on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Availability (how many products are on-hand)
</li>
<li>
Actual photos of the product.
</li>
<li>
The size and fabric.
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Staffs/employees has difficulties in knowing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If there is any new or ongoing confirmed order.
</li>
<li>
Status update of the ongoing order.
</li>
<li>
The details of the orders.
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Seldomly encodes information as it takes too long to manually record on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sales and expenses
</li>
<li>
Customer information
</li>
<li>
Customer order
</li>
<li>
The availability of raw materials inside the inventory
</li>
</ul>
4. Inconsistent recording of sales and transactions of customers, alongside with its order details and customer information, that leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Inaccurate reading of business profit and loss
</li>
<li>
Unreliable reports
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In summary, while having a limited number of employees can pose challenges in managing business activities, proactive measures such as implementing technology solutions and optimizing processes can help mitigate these challenges and lead to improved productivity and success in the long run.

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>The pandemic has caused businesses to adapt quickly, using social media platforms such as Facebook and e-commerce platforms to sell their products. Fleeky Curtains is an independent family business that provides curtain products. They operate the business at the local household and book a courier to pick up the item and deliver the item to the customer. They aim to grow their market share in the home product industry by observing and adapting to the behavior of the consumers. The employees in the business consist of the members of the family where they take charge of the sewing, assemble the packaging, the messages at Facebook, Shopee inquiries, product inspection, and one that list and encode transactions and customer information. Despite having a limited number of employees, the business wishes to accomplish tasks at an efficient rate due to the lack of workforce/person. The most important details in this text are the production time, packaging time, encoding time, number of products and raw materials, inquiries, available products, expanding the potential clients, and the staff. Fleeky Curtains mentioned that when there is no assistant, the staff finishes the tasks behind time, and that handling and assembling the packaging of one customer order takes 25 minutes of their time. Additionally, the staff must cope with their sleep and roles at work or school, and they must adapt to the market. Fleeky Curtains is an e-commerce company that uses a variety of materials to produce their products. Raw materials such as fabrics, threads, grommet, and curtain rings are used to build a finish product, and packaging materials such as bubble wrap are used to cover the products. Spending activities are traced and recorded within an Excel sheet, and customer data is stored in an Excel sheet. Customer data helps them to identify customer behavior and consumerism, and user experience is most observed when presented with convenience. They have gained knowledgeable feedback and experience revolving to their current system and workflows. Spotlight interviewed one of the admins that handle Fleeky Curtains, Mr. Neil Albert Garcia, to discuss their pain points when it comes to handling their business. These include fees and expenses to the e-commerce platform, poor delivery system, manual encoding of customer details, raw materials and on-hand stocks not documented and audited, finding ways to expand their clients and markets, and manual reports and tracing the performance of the business. These inputs will help align the project with the client's needs and interests. </p>

<h2>Project Purpose/Justification</h2>

<p>The existing system may be improved by implementing contemporary technology, moving to a better design, and allowing administrators to quickly monitor operations, inventory, and activity. Fleeky Hub will also help employees complete their responsibilities more quickly by tracking departing orders, understanding what has to be packed, what needs to be prepared, what inventories are available, and encoding client information. Prospective company owners, particularly those with small firms, can benefit from Project Akbay's efficiency features, which will allow them to handle orders more quickly and monitor their operations. The relevance of the project for developers, future researchers, company owners, administrators, and employees is that it will provide them with a better grasp of how to design, improve, and execute a stronger basis for their product. Objectives for Sustainable Development (SDGs SDG 8 to increase economic productivity and SDG 9 to develop and promote innovative technology both complement the initiative. The use of the product and the recording of the study will help future studies and offer a better answer for those in need.</p>

<h2>Business Need/Case</h2>

<p>To manage the online business, a robust digital tool is needed to reduce the staff's role in the processes involved at encoding and operations. Adapting to technology can resolve challenges quickly and enable the staff to finish quickly at their role and finish other agendas. Whereas the nature of the business advertises at Facebook since Fleeky Curtains gain customers at the site. They also handle customer inquiries at Facebook and leave their booking information at the chat. The employees of Fleeky Curtains extend their work for the customer by creating order and courier booking for the customer. They also encode customer details at Excel and record the product that he/she purchased and its value, quantity, and type of product. </p>

<h2>Business Objectives</h2>

<p>Fleeky Curtains is an online business shop that provides comfort, joy, and warm satisfaction to customers with their curtain needs. It is established in 2021 and currently residing their operations and manufacturing at the local household. The business strives to position themselves in the competition by providing top-notch services, products, and purchase experience to all consumers.

Technical limits: Fleeky Curtains may suffer technological constraints such as restricted access to certain technologies or limitations in the available resources, hardware or software.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<p>In creating a website for Fleeky Curtains, targeting the customers and their market should be considered on the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	Consumers will be interested in buying curtains online and will trust the website to deliver high-quality items and customer service. 
    </li>
	<li>
	There is a substantial market demand for curtains and window coverings to meet the website's business strategy and revenue targets. 
	</li>
	<li>
	When compared to other online and physical merchants, the website will be able to provide comparable prices. 
	</li>
	<li>
	The website will have access to a trustworthy and cost-effective supply chain for obtaining curtains from manufacturers and suppliers. 
	</li>
	<li>
	The website will be able to recruit and keep a strong team of web developers, designers, and marketing specialists to establish and operate the website.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Preliminary Scope Statement</h2>

<p>The scope of this project is to develop a website that helps the employees of Fleeky Curtains manage their customers, and their orders, by redirecting them to make purchases at the site. The main scope is for businesses to be able to address staff's challenges at their tasks and cater to their customers in an efficient way. The project also aims to aid the efficiency for businesses that do their ordering systems manually, enabling to increase the business' efficiency in handling continuous orders and documenting transactions and information seamlessly. The group will be looking to become a website to reduce the staff's time in handling customer inquiries on the products and direct the customer to order inside the website, as well as to navigate according to the customer liking and put the business in a leading edge compared to its competitors. </p>

<h2>Risks</h2>

<p>There are several business risks linked with selling curtains online. A curtain firm may encounter the following risks, which are among of the most frequent:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	Cybersecurity risks: Internet commerce platforms are susceptible to assaults that might lead to the loss of confidential consumer information or interfere with daily operations. To secure their data and client information, businesses must make sure they have proper security measures in place. 
	</li>
	<li>
	Logistics and shipping: To deliver their goods, online selling platforms must rely on logistics and shipping partners. Inaccuracies or delays in the shipping procedure might lead to missing or damaged goods, unhappy customers, and perhaps lost sales. 
	</li>
        <li>
	Reputation risks: Include negative customer experiences like subpar products, delayed delivery, or bad customer service. Negative criticism may be amplified through social media and online review platforms, therefore it's critical for businesses to actively manage their online reputation. 
	</li>
        <li>
	Pricing and competition: The internet marketplace may be quite competitive, with numerous merchants providing the same things at various price points. To preserve profitability while still being competitive, businesses must control their pricing strategy. 
	</li>
        <li>
	Technical risks: Online selling platforms depend on technology to run, and problems with that technology can cost businesses money and make customers unhappy. To reduce the risk of technical difficulties, businesses must have a strong technological infrastructure.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>To guarantee the long-term viability of their business, Fleeky Curtains must evaluate and reduce these risks. A curtains company can lessen the potential negative impact on their business and customers and position themselves for success in the online selling space by putting measures in place to manage these risks, such as investing in cybersecurity, working with reputable logistics and shipping providers, offering top-notch customer service, and complying with legal and regulatory requirements.</p>

<h2>Summary Budget</h2>

<p>The following table contains a summary budget based on the planned cost components and estimated costs required for successful completion of the project. However, since the project is only done at in-house development and hosting the site online will be pushed for future development, this is the summary budget estimated for the deployment.  </p>

<h2>Project Approval Requirements</h2>

<p>Success for the Fleeky Hub will be achieved when a fully tested intranet security solution, and all technical documentation, is fully deployed throughout the company, Fleeky Curtains, within the time and cost constraints indicated in this charter.  Additionally, this measure of success must include a recommendation list for future security considerations as we fully anticipate the necessity of this solution to evolve in order to prevent future threats. Success will be determined by the Project Sponsor, Ms. Mitzi Garcia, who will also authorize completion of the project.  </p>

<h2>Project Manager</h2>

<p>Other from defining project roles and duties, Neil Garcia will also need to set project goals and timetables, assign resources, track progress, identify risks and concerns, provide quality control, manage the project budget, interact with stakeholders, and gather feedback. He will also need to ask for comments, handle any difficulties or concerns, and give frequent updates on the project's development. Furthermore, Neil Garcia would be the strength of the project since he knows how the business works and what the business needs whilst developing the said project.</p>

=Stakeholder Strategy Management Plan=

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Fleeky Hub is a small curtain company that provides clients with high-quality curtains. Fleeky Hub's success is reliant not only on its capacity to produce high-quality draperies, but also on its capacity to manage its stakeholders. Stakeholder management is a vital componentof any business, as it includes identifying, analyzing, and establishing relationships with stakeholders.</p><p> Stakeholders are people, organizations, and groups invested in a business' success. Customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders, and the local community may be included among Fleeky Hub's stakeholders. Effective stakeholder management requires a comprehension of the needs and expectations of each stakeholder group and the development of strategies to meet those needs and expectations.</p><p> This stakeholder management strategy is intended to provide Fleeky Hub with a framework for effectively managing its stakeholders. This strategy will define the organization's main constituents, their interests, expectations, and how the organization will engage and communicate with them. By implementing this strategy, Fleeky Hub can foster positive relationships with its stakeholders, which will contribute to the company's long-term success.</p>

<h2>Stakeholders Identification</h2>

<p>The project team may use the Brainstorming methodology to uncover potential stakeholders that may not be identified right away. This could be done through creating a list of potential stakeholders and conducting group discussion and brainstorming within the project team. In the stakeholder identification process, the project team may ask the possible participants there may be when it comes to their relevance and significance to the business and project so the team will be able to have their approval and support that may help the project development succeed and be able to avoid hindrance or blockage to its progress.</p><p> When identifying the stakeholders, depending on their amount of influence, interest, and involvement in the project or organization, the stakeholders can be divided into several categories. For reference, key stakeholders for the project may be those directly impacted by the project or organization, such as clients or staff, whereas secondary stakeholders are those impacted indirectly, such as vendors or regulatory bodies. Other stakeholder groups can include internal stakeholders, external stakeholders, and key stakeholders, who tend to have a substantial influence on the organization's or project's success.</p><p> With identifying the stakeholders, for the project team to ensure that their interests and concerns are taken into consideration during the decision-making process and to increase support for the project or organization, stakeholders must be identified and engaged with. The chances of success can be increased, and trust can be gained while lowering resistance to change.</p>

<h2>Key Stakeholders</h2>

<p>The key stakeholders identified by the project team are those who have a significant impact on the success or failure of the project or initiative. The following are the sub-sets of stakeholders who may be identified as key stakeholders:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Customers - Since their satisfaction and loyalty are crucial to the success of the project or company, customers are frequently regarded as significant stakeholders. Organizations can improve their competitiveness and profitability by comprehending and satisfying the demands and expectations of their clients.
</li>
<li>
Employees – As employees oversee carrying out the strategies and plans that advance the business, they are essential to its success. Employee motivation and engagement can boost output, lower attrition, and enhance an organization's overall success.
</li>
<li>
Suppliers/partners - Suppliers and partners are frequently regarded as important stakeholders since they supply the products and services required for the business to run smoothly. Reliable supply chains and cost savings can be achieved by establishing strong ties with these stakeholders.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The basis behind determining which stakeholders are key stakeholders is based on the level of influence and impact they have on the project or organization. Organizations can build support for their initiatives and increase the likelihood of success by understanding and engaging with these stakeholders.</p>

<h2>Stakeholder Analysis</h2>

=Scope Management Plan=


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Fleeky Hub's scope management plan provides the best practices for using various functionalities of e-commerce websites, as well as the necessary tools to achieve clients' objectives. With the support of the team's mission and vision, the scope management plan is an asset for clients' businesses. Fleeky Hub's team will provide a comprehensive scope plan that can be achieved repeatedly by both the team and the client. </p>

<h2>Scope Management Approach</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Authority and responsibility for scope management will be held by the Project Manager, Pallas Fontiveros, who will work closely with the Project Sponsor, Ms. Mitzi Garcia, and other key stakeholders to define and manage the scope of the project. 
</li>
<li>
To determine the scope of the project, a Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, and a comprehensive Statement of Work (SOW) will be developed. These documents will precisely specify the project's objectives, activities, and prerequisites, and will undergo evaluation and endorsement by the project sponsor and other involved parties prior to commencing the work. 
</li>
<li>
The project's extent will be evaluated and confirmed using quality checklists, measurements of work performance, and regular monitoring of the project's advancement in relation to the original scope. If there are any discrepancies from the initial scope, they will be identified and dealt with using the scope change process. 
</li>
<li>
The Fleeky Hub project's procedure for modifying its scope will entail the Project Manager submitting a request for scope change, which will then be approved by the project sponsor. It is crucial to thoroughly assess any alterations to the project's scope to ensure that they are consistent with the project's objectives and do not have a detrimental impact on the project schedule or budget. 
</li>
<li>
The project manager will ensure that all project requirements are met and that the project sponsor and other important stakeholders approve and accept the final project deliverables. The project will be considered successfully completed only after all deliverables have been accepted and any remaining issues have been addressed. 
</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the schedule is baselined as a major aspect of progressive elaboration, defining activities later may uncover new extension that was not envisaged previously. This ought to be taken care of through formal change control. Thus, change ask for is added to the is procedure as additional outputs. At the point when such changes are joined the plans and baselines will experience updates. The same are reflected as additional outputs. The development approach will altogether impact planning approach, evaluating methods, devices and how the schedule is managed and controlled.</p>

<p>I – Informed of when an action/decision has been made</p>
<h2>Staffing Management</h2>
<h2>Staff Acquisition:</h2>
<p>            For the JIT Project, the project staff will consist of three teams; the Project Management Team, Development Team, and Quality Team. The planning stage is where the project team would outsource and contract members or external entities that would aid the project team to success. The Project Manager will negotiate with the functional leaders in the team to identify required skills and resources that must be allocated in accordance with the project management structure. All staff and resources must be approved by the relevant functional leader before the staff and resources may begin any project work. The project team will share location of the project to ensure the consistency throughout the whole project.</p>
<h2>Resource Calendars:  </h2>
<p>            The JIT Project development will last for ten months including the planning, quality testing, and closeout documents. All resources must be identified and evaluated before the project can start. The resources histogram illustrates that the project team are split into three teams mainly Project Management, Development, and Quality team. They are required to perform between specific times to complete a task assigned to the team which explains the shift in the required hours each month. The Project Management Team required to perform 8 hours a day which will accumulate to 185 hours per month within the one to two months and nine to ten months of JIT Project. The job of Project Management is to guide the other teams on the tasks assigned to them.</p>
<p>            The Project Development Team is required to perform 8 hours a day and 185 hours per month within the three months to eight months of JIT Project Development since within this time they are the one developing the JIT Project. After the required months the required hours will begin to lessen. The Quality Management team has the most inconsistent required of hours because they need an output first before performing their task. In the first three months of the JIT Project they don’t have any hours of required at all since they do not have any work assigned to them yet. After three months, they are required to perform at least four to five hours of time. During the last two months, the required time begins to increase.</p>

<h2>Training:</h2>
<p>There is no training schedule with regards to the JIT Project since the Project Management outsource staff has the required skills sets. However, if training requirements are identified, funding will be provided from the project reserve.</p>
<h2>Performance Reviews:  </h2>
<p>Before releasing project resources, the project manager will review other team leader’s evaluation report of their member’s assigned work activities at the onset of the project and communicate all expectations of work to be performed. The project manager will then evaluate the performance of each team member throughout the project to see how effectively they are completing their assigned work.</p>

=Work Breakdown Structure=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            The Work Breakdown Structure is breakdown of all the work packages necessary to complete, presented here represents all the work required to complete this project. A WBS is constructed Outline View Structure to develop to easily navigate and understand the structure how to accomplish this project, it also represents the work identified in the approved Project Scope Statement and serves as an Initial Schedule Development and Cost Estimating. We do the WBS is help more accurately and specifically define and organize the scope of the whole project. Also, to help with assigning responsibilities, resource allocation, monitoring and controlling the project.</p>

<h2>Procurement Constraints</h2>
<p>
	<strong>
		Schedule:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		Project schedule of procurement activities, contract administration, and contract fulfillment is must be established in the JIT Project Management. Any request of changes with these activities must go through the process of change control.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		If any risk occurred, it must be mitigate as soon as possible using the mitigation plan created for the procurement. Any request of change schedule and budget must go through the process of JIT Project Schedule Management.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Cost:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		Project budget has contingency and management reserves built in; however, these reserves may not be applied to procurement activities. Reserves are only to be used in the event of an approved change in project scope or at management&rsquo;s discretion.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Since the procured services can be procured at the close out of the JIT Project Management, specifically the turn-over of the Website. If there is any delay occurred, it can be ignored and change the schedule.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Scope:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		All the procured services must be justified to what cause would the JIT Project to have gain in said services. All the procurement activities must comply to the JIT Project scope such as the target budget, efficiency of the Website, etc., if there are any activities that does not relate to the project scope will be identified as out of scope.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Resources:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		All procured services are within the planned budget therefore must be perform and manage by the project manager accordingly to the plan. There will be no additional personnel to manage the activities nor re-allocated to support the procurement activities on this project.
	</ul>
<p>
	<strong>
		Technology:
	</strong>
</p>
	<ul>
		The services have already been identified by the project team and will be included in the statemen of work as part of the RFP. While the vendor&rsquo;s&rsquo; proposal may include suggestion or alternative to the procured services but must keep in mind that it will be same service in the statement of work.
	</ul>

<h2>Decision Criteria</h2>
<p>
	The criteria for the selection and award of procurement contracts under this project will be based on the following decision criteria:
</p>
<ul>
	<ul>
		Vendor&rsquo;s Customer Support
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Performance
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Quality
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Cost
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Comparison of outsourced cost versus in-sourcing
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Past performance
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	These criteria will be measured by the Project Manager. The ultimate decision will be made based on these criteria as well as available resources.
</p>

<h2>Vendor Management</h2>
<p>
	The Project Manager is responsible for searching for the vendors as well as managing them. The Project Manager and the vendor will meet weekly with the contract and each vendor will discuss the services they offer and status. The meeting can be in person or by telecommunications. The purpose of the meetings to have an agreement between the vendor and the project manager because the project manager will inspect the service whether is good or not. This also will give the project manager whether the service is capable enough to comply with the project requirements establish in the project objectives. It also serves as an opportunity to ask questions. The project manager will be responsible for scheduling this meeting until the end of the contract.
</p>
<h2>Performance Metrics for Procurement Activities</h2>
<p>
	While the Subscribing and contracts department has their own internal metrics for procurement, the following metrics are established for vendor performance for this project&rsquo;s procurement activities. Each metric is rated on a 1-3 scale as indicated below:
</p>

=Risk Management Plan=

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>            The JIT Project Management anticipated that risk and uncertainty of event that comes along with developing new and unique project. That said, the JIT Project Management takes advantage of the anticipated results by creating Risk Management Plan. The purpose of the Risk Management Plan is to establish the framework in which the JIT Project team will identify risk and developing strategies to counter act or avoid those risk. However, before risk can be identified and managed, there are preliminary project elements which must be completed. These elements are outlined in the risk management approach.</p>
<p>This project is considered a high-risk project as its function is to be the main transaction for the company of MC Manabat. The project’s function involves money transaction and confidential information transfer between the process of the JIT Project’s website, so the security of the website must be tested and check regularly to avoid implications within the business.</p>
<p>Before risk management begins it is imperative that a foundation is established for providing structured project information, thus, the following project elements were completed and defined prior to developing this Risk Management Plan:</p>
<ul>
	<ul><strong>Scope, Schedule, and Cost Management Plan must first be established to include:</strong></ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>Estimation of JIT Project cost and finalization of budget.</ul>
		<ul>Established Performance Metric System</ul>
		<ul>Identify the Work Modules of the JIT Project</ul>
		<ul>Identify the available Resources for the Project.</ul>
		<ul>Established a Work Schedule relative to the Work Modules.</ul>
		<ul>Developer Project WBS/WBS Dictionary.</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul><strong>Define the scope and limitation of the following:</strong></ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>Schedule Management Plan</ul>
		<ul>Cost Management Plan</ul>
		<ul>Quality Management Plan</ul>
		<ul>Stakeholder Management Plan</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
	<ul><strong>Define Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities</strong></ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>Project Manager chairs the risk assessment meetings</ul>
		<ul>Project team participates in risk assessment meetings and members serve as meeting recorder and timekeeper</ul>
		<ul>Key stakeholders participate in risk assessment meetings</ul>
		<ul>Project Adviser may participate in risk assessment meetings</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Top Three Risks</h2>
<p>The top three high probability and high impact risks to The JIT Project are:</p>
<p><strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong></p>
<p>Due to the Internet of things gradually growing more of the securities are breach and it is important to the JIT Project especially dealing with money transaction to prevent or create a mitigation plan when event happens. The project manager will ensure that the risk of prevent or mitigate authorized person to hi-jack or acquire confidential information in the JIT Project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Time Management</strong></p>
<p>Due to the uncertainty of event that the Project Management assumes that will happen throughout the Project that will result in delaying of the project schedule as well as wasting resources for the JIT Project requires a plan of action of the process that will happen in case a problem event occurs. The Project Manager will mitigate the risk for the problems that will happen in the future and will have a back-up plan a ready.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Consistency of the Project </strong></p>
<p>Due to ineffective methodology and practice can lead the Project Management to have a risk in the Consistency of the project that will result in unintentional change of plans in the Project that will lead a dissatisfaction and disappointment of the Project Stakeholders and Client of the project. The project manager will mitigate the risk and it will require the members to adjust so that the Project Management will use as the standard practice.</p>
<h2>Risk Management Approach</h2>
<p>            The risk analysis regarding information systems that JIT Project Management have taken approach to manage risk for this project which the Project Management identified and ranked the various risks. The Project Team prioritize the highest impact risk were added to project schedule to ensure that the risk would minimize its probability of becoming a problem as well as taking the necessary precaution to implement the mitigation response plan at the appropriate time. Team leaders assigned in the risk management will inform status updates on their assigned risks and must be updated weekly by having the meetings with the project manager, but only when the meetings include their risk’s planned timeframe. Before the completion of the project, during closing process, the project manager will analyze the risk as well as the process to it. Based on the analysis, the project manager will identify any improvements that can be added to the risk management process for the Project Client to know as part of the maintenance of the website after the turnover has happened.</p>
<h2><strong>Risk Identification</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>            For the JIT Project, risk analysis method used by the Project team to identify risk is Qualitative Risk Analysis. The risk assessment meeting representatives discuss and create scenarios that outline the potential threats to the business and rank these threats according to the severity of the potential problems if it occurred. The procedure writing scenarios for the major risk, estimating the effects of event, if it happened, and creating a counter measures and safeguards against the event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Simulation Test</strong></p>
<p>One Security Analyst (SA) is involved in the project. The SA will simulate cyber-attack against the JIT Project to test the website whether the penetration of the SA will be successful, or the website would safely be unaffected by the attack. The result will be documented, and the JIT Project will be improved based on the comments and suggestion of the SA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reserve Funds</strong></p>
<p>A risk assessment meeting discussing allocating resources for uncertainty of events and must be only used when occurrence of the problem arises in the project management.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Daily Team Meeting</strong></p>
<p>Each team leader must discuss the status of their members about work assigned to them, what are the issues that they encounter, what solutions they need to work on, and what they will do for the day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risk Assessment Meeting</strong></p>
<p>A risk assessment meeting was held with key team leaders and stakeholders. The risks identified during this meeting were added to the project plan and Risk Table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Historical Review of Similar Projects</strong></p>
<p>The project team reviewed the history of similar projects to determine the most common risks and the strategies used to mitigate those risks.</p>

<h2>Risk Qualification and Prioritization</h2>
<p>            To determine the severity of the risk that will be identified by the team, a probability and impact was used as metric to the assigned risk. This process allowed the team leaders and project manager to prioritize risk based on the severity of the effect that the risk would have on the project. The project manager utilized a probability-impact matric to manage the team leader in moving each risk to the appropriate place on the table. Once the risks were assigned a probability and impact and placed in the appropriate position on the table, documenting the finished website and the project manager moved the process on to the next step: risk mitigation/avoidance planning.</p>
<h2>Risk Monitoring</h2>
<p>            The project schedules an assigned team member for each risk. During the daily meeting between leaders and members is assigned for each risk. The meeting will discuss the status of their work and as well as the risk associated to it. There will be a discussion of risk if the team member is assigned to do the work module with risk probability to it. Risk monitoring will be a continuous process throughout the life of the JIT Project. As risk approach on the JIT project the project manager will check the team leader’s status report of risk management of their members as well as the leaders with necessary status updates which include the risk status, identification of trigger conditions, and the documentation of the risk response.</p>
<h2>Risk Mitigation and Avoidance</h2>
<p>            The project manager ensures to aid team leader in developing and improving responses to each identified risk. As more risk are identified, if the risk is qualified based on the metric established, the team has to respond to develop avoidance and mitigation strategies to the risk. The identified risk will be also added to the risk register or in the table and the project plan to ensure that they are monitored when the work involves those risk.</p>
<p>            The risk for the JIT Project will be managed and controlled within the constraints of schedule, authority, and budget cost. All identified risk will be analyzed to determine how the risk will impact the time, scope, cost. The project manager with the assistance of the project team experts will determine the efficient way to deal with each risk to ensure that everything goes according to plan. There will be cases that it will be necessary to allow the project to extend its budget cost. If only necessary to allow the JIT Project for more resources to meet the deadline and requirements of the JIT project.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Register</strong></p>
<p>            The Risk Register is a log or list of all identified risk of the JIT Project. The list consists of risk description of their probability and impact, the category they belong to, mitigation strategy, and what event would trigger them. The risk register was identified in the project management meeting led by the project manager. During this meeting, the project team identified that there is a need of creating a risk management plan that the project team categorized each risk. In addition, the team assigned each risk will prioritize according to the probability and impact of the risk it could potentially have. The risk register also describes the mitigation strategy on each risk.</p>
<p>The identified risk in the risk register, each risk has been classified and added to the project plan. When the work module contains a risk—prior to when the risk is going to occur—the project manager will assign a leader to ensure adherence to the agreed mitigation strategy. Each assigned leader will provide the status of the risk relevant to their group in their daily project meeting.</p>

=Communication Management Plan=

<h2>Introductions</h2>
<p>The reason of creating a Communications Management Plan is for the project team to determine what are the communication requirements for the project and how information will be delivered. Communications Management Plan will be the one setting the scheme for the communications of the project, it will serve as a guide for the project team members throughout the duration of the project and it will only be changed or updated when needed. It also determines and describe the roles of persons involved in the project.</p>
<h2>Communication Management Approach</h2>
<p>The project manager will be the one responsible in ensuring effective communications on this project. The project manager will be allocating most of his time looking out for the project and reporting the performance of the project to the project team members and stakeholders, he will also be responsible organizing meeting, creating the project plan, constructing and reading emails, meeting with his project team members and managing the work being performed by them.</p>
<p>By having a good communication management approach a lot of project management problems can be prevented.</p>
<h2>Communication Management Constraints</h2>
<p>            Every project is no exception to limitation and constraints because they must be within the scope of the project and comply with its budget, scheduling and resource necessity. So the project planning and documentation is also limited and constrained. There must be an administrative or organizational policy requirements that must be followed as part of communications management and these constraints must be clearly discussed to all the project stakeholders and make sure that all of them have understood.</p>
<p>            All activities in the project communication will appear within the project’s approved budget, schedule and resource allocations. The one who will be responsible in ensuring that all communication activities are performed by the project team without external resources that may affect the budget and exceed the authorized budget is the project manager.</p>
