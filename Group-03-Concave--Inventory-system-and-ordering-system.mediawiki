<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p align=" justify">
The Inventory system and Ordering system is a web-app and a mob-app base for Torrecamps Company. Initially, they had their attention to "pandemic essentials" such facemasks, alcohol, tissues, and gloves. The application will serve as their main medium for processing the customer’s order.

The mobile application for the customer will be limited only to android OS. For customers that walk-in, the admin will process their order using the ordering system that the group develops. Their mode of payment will be limited also to cash on delivery or COD in short.

Currently the client is doing their transactions manually, getting the orders manually, relying on Microsoft excel for its inventory, and no database of their customer and supplier makes it to have a human error of 30% out of 100% when they produce handwritten receipts.

Integrating their current transaction process into the digitalized set up by developing the system for inventory and ordering system that would make it more efficient and transparent way for the customer’s end.
