<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p align=" justify">
The Inventory system and Ordering system is a web-app and a mob-app base for Torrecamps Company. Initially, they had their attention to "pandemic essentials" such facemasks, alcohol, tissues, and gloves. The application will serve as their main medium for processing the customer’s order.

The mobile application for the customer will be limited only to android OS. For customers that walk-in, the admin will process their order using the ordering system that the group develops. Their mode of payment will be limited also to cash on delivery or COD in short.

Currently the client is doing their transactions manually, getting the orders manually, relying on Microsoft excel for its inventory, and no database of their customer and supplier makes it to have a human error of 30% out of 100% when they produce handwritten receipts.

Integrating their current transaction process into the digitalized set up by developing the system for inventory and ordering system that would make it more efficient and transparent way for the customer’s end.

<h1>Problem Definition</h1>
<h4>3.1 Problem Statement</h4>
<p align=" justify">
Since 2017, Torrecamps Marketing has been in business and has been selling essentials. They began selling "Pandemic Essentials" including alcohol and tissues during the pandemic. As a result, they gained more customers and stock, began working with other businesses, and expanded their selection of products. Their system remained static while their inventory and client base grew, making it challenging for them to keep up with the increase in orders that needed to be handled.</p>
<h4>3.2 Organizational Impact</h4>
<p align=" justify">
Having this project developed by the group can have a lot of impact if it's approved. The first one is Torrecamps Marketing. The impact this system will have on Torrecamps Marketing will be that the clients can serve customers more quickly and effectively when it comes to producing printable and digital receipts for every transaction. Next is the impact of this system on the customers. In the customers’ side, the proposed system will now produce printed receipts. This is crucial since printed receipts cannot be changed. </p>
<h4>3.3 Technology Migration</h4>
<p align=" justify">
Torrecamps Marketing currently uses desktop computers, laptops and printers for their main hardware. They also use Facebook messenger, Microsoft Excel and a 25 MBPS Converge internet provider as their main network. These tools provide a lot of things going for the client. Like facebook they post pictures with prices to advertise them. Next is customers can order their desired items using facebook messenger. And lastly there will be Microsoft Excel. Excel provides the client with a lot of things like listing customer information and listing orders. Next is printing receipts and fixing orders. Lastly there is the inventory and total sales per day. 

Now that the group is tasked to create a system that helps the clients. The proposed solution of the team that will be implemented is an inventory and an ordering system. The website will be able to present the items that the client is selling. Then every order of the customer will be recorded into the inventory and the ordering system.  The team will use Bootstrap studio, Visual Studio Code and XAMPP to develop the project. The website will intergrate CAMSS. The system will have a cloud-based database server. Next is tye project will have an inventory and ordering system where they can create, edit, or delete all items and information that are needed to change on the website. 3rd will be that the team plans to integrate the system in both desktop and mobile devices. The Facebook part will not be removed since it is used for their advertisement. Lastly the team will continue monitoring the website and install anti-malware software on the computer to ensure their security.
