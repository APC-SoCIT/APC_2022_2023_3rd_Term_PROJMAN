==16.6 Property Transition==
<b>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</b>

In the case of the Barangay South Signal Village Web App, the client has no prior system before the project has been done. All processes were conducted manually through a physical workforce and the storage are physical file cabinets. The system of the barangay before the project is all paper based so there will be no issues regarding the transition of all the intellectual properties. In terms of the election of the new barangay chairperson, all the legalities that are needed during the transition will be handled by the client.

<b>USER ACCOUNTS AND PASSWORDS</b>

For the South Signal Village Barangay Web App, the objective of this implementation plan is to outline the stages and procedures for implementing user accounts and passwords.
