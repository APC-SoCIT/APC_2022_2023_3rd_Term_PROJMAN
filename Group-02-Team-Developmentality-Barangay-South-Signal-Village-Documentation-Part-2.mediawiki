=10. WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE=

==10.1 Introduction==

The Work Breakdown Structure or WBS is a hierarchical breakdown of the project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components. The WBS provides a framework for the team for organizing their project work and helps them to identify the activities needed to complete their project.

The purpose of the WBS is to break down the project into manageable work packages that can be planned, monitored, and controlled. By breaking down the project into smaller components, it is easier for the team to estimate the effort required to complete each task, assign responsibilities to team members, and track progress against the project plan. It is an essential tool for project managers and provides a visual representation of the project scope and objectives. The WBS is a key component of the project management plan and is developed during the project's planning phase. The WBS helps the team to ensure that all project activities are accounted for, and nothing is overlooked or missed.

Listed below are the project deliverables, project work, activities required to complete each deliverable and the resources needed to complete the project. Such as choosing a project client, choosing a consultant, creating all papers needed for the project, and the expected labor to cost. 

The Work Breakdown Structure presented here represents all the work required to complete this project.

==10.3 Hierarchical Structure==

The hierarchical structure makes it easy to see how the different components of a project fit together and how the work is distributed across the project team. It also helps to ensure that all the necessary work is identified and accounted for, which can reduce the risk of schedule delays or cost overruns for the team.

This management strategy will clearly define the methods for addressing risks and overseeing their progress. The effectiveness of the plan will be assessed based on how promptly risks are identified and resolved, and whether the project's goals are successfully met.

==13.2 Top Three Risk==
The following are the risks for the Barangay South Signal Village Web-Application identified by the team. The project manager will choose and use the proper risk reduction and avoidance measures to reduce the likelihood of these hazards.
<br> <br>
#External Security Threats: External attacks may compromise the web application's security. Malicious assaults, hacking efforts, and unauthorized access to sensitive information are examples of such risks.
#Data Theft or Loss: Data theft or loss is possible due to potential security breaches. Unauthorized access or security breaches in the web application might compromise or lose sensitive data, such as the residents' and barangay information needed for protection. 
#Unpredictable Risks: the project team is aware of the possibility of unpredictable risks (natural disasters, power outages, and internet disruptions) happening that could cause an impact on the project.

==13.3 Risk Management Approach==
After identifying potential risks that the project team may encounter, the team will then proceed to discuss these risks with the project sponsor. The team will collaborate with the project sponsor on the ideal response that the team will implement. After the discussion and the implementation, the team will analyze the mitigation response and will apply improvements if deemed necessary.
<br> <br>
Agile methodology is the methodology that the Barangay South Signal Village Web Application is based on. Thus, the team will follow the risk management for the agile methodology. Risk management involves quick and accurate response and identification of potential risks. Both the stakeholders and the team will be actively involved in the risk management process to ensure that the proper steps are taken.
<br> <br>
The following are the steps in the Risk Management Approach of the Barangay South Signal Village Web Application:
#Risk Identification: The project team will identify potential project risks through regular meetings, brainstorming sessions, project scope review, web application testing. The identified risks will be listed by each of the members that have discovered the risk based on their impact on the project.
#Risk Assessment:  After identifying potential risks, the team will then assess the identified risks based on their potential impact on the project. Severity and priority will be applied to the identified risks using a risk matrix to ensure that the risks will be properly evaluated.
#Risk Response: The team will create a risk mitigation plan for risks that have a high severity for the project. Techniques and processes in reducing, preventing, and avoiding the risks will be included in the risk mitigation plan. 
#Risk Review: The risks will be closely monitored by the team and all changes and improvements will be properly communicated with the project sponsor. The review will reassess and identify both the old and new potential risks and determine whether the risk mitigation action is effective or needs to be changed.
==13.4 Risk Identification==
The risks for Barangay South Signal Village Web Application were identified through expert interviews, historical data from previous projects, and a risk assessment meeting with the team and the stakeholders.
<br><br>
The historical data from earlier projects was thoroughly examined and researched to identify possible risks and create plans and methods for risk mitigation. Project advisors and consultants were interviewed as they are experts in developing similar systems and projects to discover new risks, manage existing risks, and develop more effective risk mitigation strategies.
<br>
The risk assessment meeting consists of both the project team and the stakeholders. The risks were evaluated by their impact on the project and risk mitigation strategies were discussed. 
<br>
The potential risks that were identified for the Barangay South Signal Village Web App consists of:
#Scope Creep: The project may go beyond its original scope. Cost overruns and schedule delays will result from this.
