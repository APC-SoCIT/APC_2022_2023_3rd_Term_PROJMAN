=Company Profile=
<p>The cafeteria is a facility of Asia Pacific College (APC) which is used by the students, staff, administrators, and faculty members of the school.
</p>
=Business Case=
==Executive Summary==
==Issue==
<p>The business problem that Rams E-Café is facing is the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their current ordering system. Currently, customers place their orders with the servers, who then manually key in the orders. This process is prone to errors, slow and inefficient, leading to long wait times for customers, and dissatisfied customers.</p>
==Anticipated Outcomes==
<p> 
With the implementation of an online ordering system, customers will have the convenience of placing their orders through a web application and picking them up at the food stall. This initiative will provide a better customer experience by reducing wait times and order errors. This will also help to reduce wastage and minimize stock-outs, ensuring that the café can operate efficiently and cost-effectively.
</p>
==Recommendation==
<p>
To address this issue, Rams E-Café is proposing the implementation of an online ordering system that allows customers to place their orders directly from their smartphones or computers. The proposed project aims to provide an online ordering system that is user-friendly, efficient, and cost-effective for both the customers and the business.
</p>
==Justification==
<p>
Rams E-Caf is recommended for implementation due to several reasons. Firstly, it will streamline the ordering process for customers, resulting in improved customer experience and satisfaction. The online platform will allow customers to place orders easily from the comfort of their homes or offices, reducing the wait time and eliminating the need for physical contact during the ordering process, which is especially important during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This will ultimately lead to increased customer loyalty and repeat business.

==Problem Definition==
<p> <b>Problem Statement</b></p>
<p>
Rams E-Caf, the business problem identified was the inefficient manual process of the cafeteria's daily operations. The cafeteria was using a traditional paper-based system for order-taking, and inventory management. This process was time-consuming, and error-prone, and, accident inventory counts, and difficulties in monitoring sales and revenue.
</p>
<p><b>Organizational Impact</b></p>
<p>
  •	To automate the cafeteria's daily operations and minimize the manual process by implementing a web-based cafeteria management system.<br>
•	To improve the accuracy and efficiency of the order-taking, billing, and inventory management process.<br>
•	To provide real-time sales and revenue monitoring capabilities to cafeteria management.<br>
•	To reduce operational costs.<br>
•	To enhance the customer experience by providing a user-friendly online ordering system.<br>
<br>
The proposed system would modify the current organizational processes by substituting the traditional paper-based system with an automated web-based system. This would require the installation of new hardware and software, including computers and servers, as well as the development of a custom software application for the cafeteria management system.
<br>
The new system would also create new roles, including system administrators, software developers, and technical support staff. Existing roles, such as cafeteria staff, would also change as they adapt to the new system and receive training on its use. Overall, the objective is to streamline and optimize the cafeteria's operations, resulting in improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.
</p>
<p><b>Technology Migration</b></p>
<p>
Rams E-Caf is a web-based cafeteria management system that will be accessed by a web browser and housed on a server. A team of IT professionals will most likely install and configure the system, working closely with cafeteria employees to ensure that the system is set up appropriately and fulfills their specific needs. The implementation process will almost certainly include numerous stages, such as system testing, user training, and data migration. 
</p>
==Project Overview==
<p><b>Project Description</b></p>
<p>
The Rams E-Caf project aims to provide a solution to the problem of long waiting times in the APC cafeteria. With the implementation of face-to-face and hybrid classes, students and staff will have less time to spare, making it crucial to manage their time effectively. Rams E-Caf is an online ordering platform exclusively for the APC community, which allows users to order their food ahead of time and pick it up at a designated time.<br>

<p><b>Goals and Objectives</b></p>
<p>
  The primary goal of the Rams E-Caf project is to improve the service time of food concessionaires, benefiting the APC community. The project's specific objectives include developing a web application with key features such as User Login, Menu for the day, Website Reports, Order and Payment System, Customer Feedback system, Dashboard for orders, and Edit Food Menu. The web application will be designed to enable food concessionaires to prepare food in advance, reduce wait times for customers, and improve overall customer experience.
</p>

<p>Low power and low interest: These stakeholders have little interest or influence in the project. They may require minimal communication and management.</p>
<p>To determine the level of impact stakeholders may have on the project, the team will use tools such as a stakeholder matrix or power/interest grid. These tools will help to identify which stakeholders may require more attention and resources to manage. The stakeholder analysis will also consider the potential risks and benefits associated with each stakeholder group. This will help the team to anticipate any conflicts or competing objectives among stakeholders and develop appropriate strategies to manage them.</p>
<p>Overall, the stakeholder analysis will enable the team to better understand the needs and expectations of each stakeholder group and develop an effective stakeholder management plan that addresses their concerns and supports the successful delivery of the project.</p>


=Scope Management Plan= 
==Introduction==
<p> The purpose of this Project Scope Management Plan is to define the scope management process for the Rams E-Caf project. The plan identifies the roles and responsibilities for managing the project scope, as well as the processes for collecting requirements, defining scope, creating a work breakdown structure, verifying scope, and controlling scope.
</p> 

<ol>
  <li><b>Collect Requirements</b> - The Rams E-Caf project team will identify and document the requirements necessary to meet all project objectives. The project charter and stakeholder register will be used to identify requirements, and the team will collectively discuss the details associated with meeting each requirement. Interviews and follow-on discussions will be conducted to clarify the requirements, and they will be documented in sufficient detail to measure them once the project begins the execution phase.</li>
  <li><b>Define Scope</b> -	The Rams E-Caf project team will develop a detailed project/product description that includes deliverables, assumptions, and constraints. This step will establish the framework within which project work must be performed and will be critical to project success.</li>
  <li><b>Create WBS</b> -	The project team will break down project deliverables into progressively smaller and more manageable components, which at the lowest level are called work packages. This hierarchical structure will allow for more simplicity in scheduling, costing, monitoring, and controlling the project.</li>
  <li><b>Verify Scope</b> - The project team will receive formalized acceptance of all deliverables with the sponsor and/or customer in the verify scope process. </li>
  <li><b>Control Scope</b> - The project team will monitor and control the project/product scope, as well as manage any changes in the scope baseline. Changes may be necessary to the project scope but must be controlled and integrated to prevent scope creep.</li>
</ol>

==Scope Management Approach==
<p>
  Authority and responsibility for the scope management will be helped by the project manager, Corneliani Jon Melo, who will work and communicate closely with the project sponsor, Ms. Bernadette Sison, and the stakeholders such as the food concessionaires.

  The scope of the project will be defined in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary and in the Statement of Work (SOW). These documents outline the project deliverables, tasks, and requirements which will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor and other stakeholders before any work in the development side begins.
  
  The scope of the project will be measured and verified with quality checklists and regular team meetings with the project sponsor. Any deviation from the scope will be addressed during the meeting and through the scope change process.
  
  The scope change process for the Rams E-Caf project will include the submission of a scope change request by the project manager with the final approval being granted by the project sponsor. Every detail included in the scope change request should be reviewed and evaluated to ensure that they align with the project goals and objectives but at the same time, does not negatively impact the project schedule and/or budget.
  
  The final project deliverables will be accepted and approved by the project sposor and the key stakeholders. The project manager on the other hand will be responsible for ensuring that all project requirements have been met. The project will be deemed successful once all of the deliverables have been accepted and any issues have been resolved.
  
</p>

==Role and Responsibilities==
<p>The content above outlines the roles and responsibilities of the key individuals involved in the Rams E-Caf project. Each role has specific responsibilities and is essential to the successful completion of the project. Understanding the roles and responsibilities of each team member is crucial to ensure effective communication and collaboration throughout the project's life cycle. By defining the roles and responsibilities, the project manager can set expectations, delegate tasks, and manage resources efficiently.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Project Manager:</b> The project manager is responsible for leading and managing the project team to achieve the project objectives within the constraints of time, budget, and scope.</li>
  <li><b>Developer/IT Head</b> The responsibility of a developer is to write, test, and maintain code that meets the project's requirements and is of high quality.</li>
  <li><b>UI/UX Designer</b> Responsible for creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces for digital products that meet user needs and business objectives.</li>
  <li><b>Documentation</b> The responsibility of a documentation specialist is to ensure that all project documentation is complete, accurate, and up to date.</li>
  <li><b>Stakeholders</b> Responsible for providing input, feedback, and making critical decisions related to the project to ensure its success.</li>
</ol>

==Scope Definition==
<p>
  The scope definition for the Rams E-Caf project was developed after the requirements were identified and defined during the requirements definition process. Three documents were created during this process, namely Project Charter, Business Case, and a Stakeholder Management Plan. These documents were used as references when defining the project's scope.

  The scope definition process involved developing a detailed description of the project and its deliverables. The Rams E-Caf project aims to create a fully functional e-commerce website for Rams Cafe that will allow customers to purchase food and beverage items online. The deliverables of the project include a functional website, a payment gateway for online transactions, and a user-friendly interface.
  
  To define the project's scope, various tools and techniques were used, such as expert judgment and product analysis. Expert judgment was used to gather inputs from industry experts and stakeholders on the project's requirements and deliverables. Product analysis was done to understand the market trends and competition to ensure that the project meets the customers' demands.
  
</p>

==Project Scope Statement==
<p>
  The project's goal is to address the issues of long wait times, inefficient use of manpower, and the implementation of social distancing guidelines by the IATF in the APC cafeteria with the development of an alternative online ordering system. The project will deliver a functional web application that meets the requirements of the stakeholders and improves the overall cafeteria experience for the APC community which consists of students, staff, and faculty members. The successful completion of the project will be measured by user satisfaction, decreased wait times, increased efficiency for the cafeteria's food concessionaires, and adherence to social distancing guidelines, as well as avoid the long queues with also achieving to process food with a timely manner.
 
  The users will only focus on the APC community and will not include non-APC community and non-APC concessionaires. The project will not include creating a native mobile application hence its infrastructure will be web-based and will be available through most browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Firefox. This will only be accessible by having an internet connection hence the project will only focus on this and will exclude problems of having no internet connection. Additionally, the focus solution is to digitalize the ordering system of APC cafeteria and will not interfere changing the lunch time or break time of the APC community, as well as all other solutions.
  
  Furthermore, the project will be supported by the APC by providing monitors or tablets depending on the chosen devices by the concessionaires thus there is no technology constraint. However, the project is subject to budget constraints, as it depends on approval from the project sponsor. Time is also a constraint, as the project must be completed by the end of the term and deliverables must be completed on schedule. The project must deliver a fully functional web application that meets the requirements of the stakeholders and is accepted by them as complete within the available resources and timeline.
  
  The successful completion of the project is based on shared assumptions between the project team and stakeholders. It is assumed that both parties understand the requirements and objectives of the project, and the project team has the technical capability and access to resources to develop and implement the online web application and it is assumed that both parties have agreed on the scope of the project. Moreover, the project team and stakeholders are committed to complying with all relevant laws, rules and regulations, guidelines, including those related to data privacy and security. Consequently, the importance of social distancing and other safety measures to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 is understood, and the implementation of the web application is assumed to aid these measures.

==Work Breakdown Structure==
<p>
  Scope management is a critical aspect of project management that involves defining, documenting, and controlling the project's boundaries. One of the essential tools for effective scope management is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), which is used to break down the project scope into smaller, manageable components. The WBS is then used to create the WBS Dictionary, which provides detailed information on the work packages, activities, and tasks required to complete each component. In this section, we will discuss how the project scope for Rams E-Caf will be subdivided into smaller deliverables in the WBS and WBS Dictionary and how these components will be managed during the project's life cycle.

<p>By following this scope control plan, the project team can ensure that the project remains within the defined boundaries and is completed within the set timeframe and budget.</p>

=Cost Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>
  In broader terms, the Rams E-Caf project's cost management plan is created to make sure that all project expenses are efficiently handled and kept under control, allowing the project to be finished within the allocated budget. This will make it more likely that the project will be successfully and promptly finished.
 
  Cost Management Responsibilities
  ·	The Project Manager oversees the project's overall cost management and serves as the point of contact for any potential costing problems.
  ·	The finance team oversees making sure that the project's approved budget is being monitored.
   
  Cost Measurement and Reporting
  ·	Using a cost performance index (CPI) and a schedule performance index (SPI), costs will be tracked and reported.
  Cost Change Approval
  ·	Before making and putting into effect the following adjustments to the cost management, the project manager must give his or her approval.
  ·	The Project Sponsor must be consulted and given approval before any changes to the costing or budget are made.
  Budget Format and Standards
  ·	A spreadsheet will be used to present the budgets and plot them in depth.
  ·	If there are updates or adjustments to the costings, the budgets will be noted.

</p> 

==Cost Management Approach==
<p>
  The following guiding concepts will serve as the foundation for the dispatch directory system project's cost management strategy:

1.	Costs are defined clearly:
    To properly identify and document project costs, including labor, materials, equipment, and other expenses, the project team will collaborate closely with stakeholders.
2.	Budget creation and monitoring:
    Costs will be tracked and reported in real time, and a thorough project budget will be created and frequently updated throughout the project.
3.	Cost projections:
    To make sure that the project budget is precise and reasonable, the project team will employ a range of cost estimation approaches.
4.	Cost variance analysis:
		The project team will do variance analysis to find and rectify any cost overruns 			or savings while keeping a tight eye on expenses throughout the project.
5.	Cost management roles and responsibilities:
		All project team members will be informed of the precise roles and duties for 			cost management.
6.	Approval process for changes:
		A formal procedure for approving adjustments to the project's budget will be 			developed and put into place.
7.	Reporting and communication:
    Regular cost reports will be created and distributed to all parties involved, such as the project sponsor, project team, and management.

</p>


==Measuring Project Cost==
<p>
  A specific method for applying Earned Value Management (EVM) to measure project costs will be included in the Cost Management Plan for the Rams E-Caf project. A specific method for applying Earned Value Management (EVM) to measure project costs will be included in the Cost Management Plan for the Rams E-Caf. This will entail keeping track of and releasing numerous Earned Value signs, including:
 
  1.	The budgeted expenses of the work that was anticipated to be finished at a particular period are measured using the terms Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV).
      The total labor expense for the TESTING WBS must be multiplied by the percentage of completion for the WBS to determine the BCWS or                                      	
  
  Planned Value:
  
  BCWS = Total labor cost of TESTING WBS x Percentage of completion
  = (PHP 140,296.26) x 33.71%
  = PHP 140,296.26
   
  
  As a result, the Planned Value (PV) or Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) for the TESTING WBS Is PHP
  
  2.	 Earned Value (EV) or Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) is a measure of the estimated price of the work that has been finished at a particular period.
   
  Example:
   
  The proportion of work completed for each job or WBS element is necessary to determine the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV). Assuming that each Testing phase task has been completed to a certain percentage:
   
  Week 40: Testing Phase 1 - 100%
  Week 41: Testing Phase 2 - 75%
  Week 42: Testing Phase 3 - 50%
  Week 43: Testing Phase 4 - 25%
   
  The Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) can then be determined as follows:
   
  EV = BCWS (*) % of work completed
  EV = (₱ 140,296.26 x 33.71%) + (₱28,059 x 8.43% x 0.75) + (₱ 28,059 x 8.43% x 0.50) + (₱28,059 x 8.43% x 0.25)
  EV = ₱47,284.67+ ₱1,77,403+ ₱118,268+ ₱59134
  EV = ₱ 402089.67
   
  As a result, the Earned Value (EV) or Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) is ₱402089.67
  
  This estimate was only based on the research of the proponent and article on getastra.
 </p>       


==Reporting Format==
<p>
  A thorough spreadsheet or table would likely be the best reporting format for the expense management strategy of the Dispatch Directory service project. The project's budget, actual costs incurred, expected costs, and any variations or inconsistencies ought to all be included in this format.
  The project team, stakeholders, and management should all be able to access the format and understand it without difficulty. To give the expense information a visual representation, a bar chart or Gantt chart can also be used. The following components would be part of the reporting format for the Dispatch Directory system project's cost management plan:
</p>  


<p>
1.Executive Summary:<br>
An outline of the project's overall budget, any significant cost issues or variations, and 	any steps taken to address them is included in the cost management plan.<br>

2.Budget Overview:<br>
A thorough financial breakdown includes the project's overall cost, the price of each 	phase or deliverable, and the price of each project resource (such as personnel, supplies, 	equipment, etc.).<br>

3.Cost Variance Analysis:<br>
A thorough examination of discrepancies between the project's estimated and actual 	costs. This should thoroughly justify the deviations' causes, their effects on the project, and any steps taken to address them.<br>

4.Budget Forecast:<br>
A projection of the project's future costs, including any potential cost variances and their potential impact on the project. <br>

5.Cost Management Metrics:<br>
A forecast of the project's foreseeable costs, considering any probable cost variations 	and their potential influence on the undertaking.<br>

6.Approval and Sign-off:<br>
The part where the cost management strategy is reviewed, approved, and signed off on by 	the project's manager and other major stakeholders.<br>

7.Appendices:<br>
Any more records or materials, including invoices, change request forms, and 	comprehensive cost breakdowns.<br>

</p>

==Cost Variance Response Process==
<p>
  The Control Thresholds for this project is a CPI or SPI of less than 0.8 or greater than 1.2.  If the project reaches one of these Control Thresholds a Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan is required.  The Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with options for corrective actions within five business days from when the cost variance is first reported.  Within three business days from when the Project Sponsor selects a corrective action option, the Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with a formal Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan.  The Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan will detail the actions necessary to bring the project back within budget and the means by which the effectiveness of the actions in the plan will be measured.  Upon acceptance of the Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan it will become a part of the project plan and the project will be updated to reflect the corrective actions.

==Cost Change Control Process==
<p>
  The following steps will be part of the cost change control process:
 
  Identification of the cost change:
  1.	A cost change request form must be used to identify and record any suggested modifications to the project's costs or budget.
  2.	Analysis of the cost change:
      The project team will evaluate the proposed modification and determine its possible impact on the project's budget, resources, and timeline.
   
  3.	Approval of the cost change:
      The project sponsor and other relevant stakeholders are going to review and authorize the request for a cost change.
                                      
  4.	Implementation of the cost change:
      Upon approval, the cost adjustment will be carried out in accordance with the	project's budget and schedule.
   
  5.	Tracking and monitoring of the cost change:
      The project team will keep tabs on how the cost change will affect the project's budget and schedule and make any required adjustments to keep things on track.
   
  6.	Reporting on the cost change:
      The project status report will include the cost change, any pertinent financial data, and any corrective actions that were implemented.
   
  The expense change control procedure will be implemented to make sure that any alterations to the project budget or expenses are quickly found, assessed, and approved. By doing this, you may lessen the effect of cost fluctuations on the project's budget and schedule and help to keep it on pace to achieve its goals.

=Time Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>
  The Schedule Management Plan is an important document that outlines the approach and procedures developing, monitoring, controlling, and reporting on the project schedule. The purpose of this plan is to ensure that the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required level of quality. A well-planned schedule management plan is crucial to achieve the succession of the project as it enables the project team to track progress against the project timeline, potential delays or issues and take corrective action.
  <br>
  This plan will describe in detail the schedule management approach that will be used to create the project schedule, the procedures for monitoring and controlling the schedule throughout the project lifecycle, as well as the process for making schedule changes and managing scope changes. It will also define the roles and responsibilities of the project team members involved in schedule management and the tools and techniques that will be used to manage the schedule.
</p>

==Schedule Management Approach==
<p>The project schedules will be created using Microsoft Project as the scheduling tool/format with the deliverables identified in the project’s Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). This will provide a visual representation of the project schedule including start and end dates of each task, dependencies, and milestones. The project schedule will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis to ensure that it remains accurate and up to date.

  Schedule milestones will be established to provide the team with a clear understanding of major project deliverables and deadlines. The following will be the milestones for the project schedule:

<p>The team will work collaboratively to develop and update the project schedule, with each member responsible for their assigned tasks and providing regular status updates. The schedule will be reviewed and updated regularly by the Project Manager to ensure that it remains accurate and up to date.</p>

==Schedule Control==
<p>The Rams E-Caf project schedule will be monitored and controlled throughout the project life cycle to ensure that the project is progressing according to the plan. The following schedule control activities will be performed:</p>

<p>Schedule Updates: The project schedule will be updated on a regular basis to reflect the latest project status. The project manager will be responsible for updating the schedule, and the updated schedule will be shared with the project team and stakeholders.</p>

<p>Schedule Reviews: The project team will conduct regular schedule reviews to identify potential schedule risks and issues. The reviews will be conducted on a weekly basis, and any significant issues will be escalated to the Project Manager for resolution.</p>

<p>Schedule Communication: The project schedule will be communicated to the project team and stakeholders on a regular basis to ensure that everyone is aware of the project’s progress. The Project Manager will be responsible for communicating the schedule, and any changes to the schedule will be communicated promptly to all relevant parties.</p>

<p>Roles and Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Project Manager is responsible for updating the project schedule, conducting regular schedule reviews, and communicating the schedule to the project team and stakeholders.</li>
  <li>The Project team members are responsible for providing accurate status updates and notifying the Project Manager of any potential schedule risks or issues.</li>
  <li>Stakeholders are responsible for reviewing the project schedule and providing feedback to the Project Manager.</li>
</ul>

<p>To implement these schedule control activities, the Rams E-Caf project team will be able to proactively manage the project schedule potential schedule risks and ensure that the project is completed on time.</p>


==Schedule Changes and Thresholds==
<p>
  The Rams E-Caf project schedule will be created based on the best available information at the time of development. As the project progresses, it is expected that there may be changes to the project schedule. Any changes to the project schedule must be requested and approved by the Project Sponsor before the changes are made.

To ensure that the project stays on track, threshold limits have been set. Any change to the schedule that exceeds the threshold limit must have a schedule change request submitted and approved by the project sponsor before the schedule change is made. The threshold limit for this project has been set at 10%. This means that any schedule change that results in a delay of 10% or more from the original schedule baseline must have a schedule change request submitted and approved by the project sponsor.

The project team is responsible for monitoring the schedule on an ongoing basis and reporting any schedule changes or potential delays to the project sponsor. The project sponsor will review and approve or deny any schedule change requests based on their impact on the project budget, resources, and overall project objectives.

</p>

==Scope Change==
<p>
  Occasionally, changes to the project scope may be necessary and approved by the project sponsor. These changes may result in the schedule needing to be re-baselined to ensure that it accurately reflects the project’s new scope. Examples of scope changes may include new deliverables or requirements that were not previously considered during the original schedule’s development.

In these situations, the Project Manager and the team must carefully evaluate the impact of the scope change on the project schedule and its resources. The project team should also consider any additional time and resources that may be required to complete the project, as well as the potential impact on other project constraints such as cost and quality.

Furthermore, before implementing any scope changes, the project team must ensure that the project sponsor approves the change request and that a corresponding schedule change request is submitted and approved. The project manager and team must update the project schedule to reflect any approved scope changes and ensure that all stakeholders are informed of the changes and their impact on the project’s schedule.
