=Company Profile=
<p>The cafeteria is a facility of Asia Pacific College (APC) which is used by the students, staff, administrators, and faculty members of the school.
</p>
=Business Case=
==Executive Summary==
==Issue==
<p>The business problem that Rams E-Café is facing is the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their current ordering system. Currently, customers place their orders with the servers, who then manually key in the orders. This process is prone to errors, slow and inefficient, leading to long wait times for customers, and dissatisfied customers.</p>
==Anticipated Outcomes==
<p> 
With the implementation of an online ordering system, customers will have the convenience of placing their orders through a web application and picking them up at the food stall. This initiative will provide a better customer experience by reducing wait times and order errors. This will also help to reduce wastage and minimize stock-outs, ensuring that the café can operate efficiently and cost-effectively.
</p>
==Recommendation==
<p>
To address this issue, Rams E-Café is proposing the implementation of an online ordering system that allows customers to place their orders directly from their smartphones or computers. The proposed project aims to provide an online ordering system that is user-friendly, efficient, and cost-effective for both the customers and the business.
</p>
==Justification==
<p>
Rams E-Caf is recommended for implementation due to several reasons. Firstly, it will streamline the ordering process for customers, resulting in improved customer experience and satisfaction. The online platform will allow customers to place orders easily from the comfort of their homes or offices, reducing the wait time and eliminating the need for physical contact during the ordering process, which is especially important during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This will ultimately lead to increased customer loyalty and repeat business.

==Problem Definition==
<p> <b>Problem Statement</b></p>
<p>
Rams E-Caf, the business problem identified was the inefficient manual process of the cafeteria's daily operations. The cafeteria was using a traditional paper-based system for order-taking, and inventory management. This process was time-consuming, and error-prone, and, accident inventory counts, and difficulties in monitoring sales and revenue.
</p>
<p><b>Organizational Impact</b></p>
<p>
  •	To automate the cafeteria's daily operations and minimize the manual process by implementing a web-based cafeteria management system.<br>
•	To improve the accuracy and efficiency of the order-taking, billing, and inventory management process.<br>
•	To provide real-time sales and revenue monitoring capabilities to cafeteria management.<br>
•	To reduce operational costs.<br>
•	To enhance the customer experience by providing a user-friendly online ordering system.<br>
<br>
The proposed system would modify the current organizational processes by substituting the traditional paper-based system with an automated web-based system. This would require the installation of new hardware and software, including computers and servers, as well as the development of a custom software application for the cafeteria management system.
<br>
The new system would also create new roles, including system administrators, software developers, and technical support staff. Existing roles, such as cafeteria staff, would also change as they adapt to the new system and receive training on its use. Overall, the objective is to streamline and optimize the cafeteria's operations, resulting in improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.
</p>
<p><b>Technology Migration</b></p>
<p>
Rams E-Caf is a web-based cafeteria management system that will be accessed by a web browser and housed on a server. A team of IT professionals will most likely install and configure the system, working closely with cafeteria employees to ensure that the system is set up appropriately and fulfills their specific needs. The implementation process will almost certainly include numerous stages, such as system testing, user training, and data migration. 
</p>
==Project Overview==
<p><b>Project Description</b></p>
<p>
The Rams E-Caf project aims to provide a solution to the problem of long waiting times in the APC cafeteria. With the implementation of face-to-face and hybrid classes, students and staff will have less time to spare, making it crucial to manage their time effectively. Rams E-Caf is an online ordering platform exclusively for the APC community, which allows users to order their food ahead of time and pick it up at a designated time.<br>

<p><b>Goals and Objectives</b></p>
<p>
  The primary goal of the Rams E-Caf project is to improve the service time of food concessionaires, benefiting the APC community. The project's specific objectives include developing a web application with key features such as User Login, Menu for the day, Website Reports, Order and Payment System, Customer Feedback system, Dashboard for orders, and Edit Food Menu. The web application will be designed to enable food concessionaires to prepare food in advance, reduce wait times for customers, and improve overall customer experience.
</p>

<p>Low power and low interest: These stakeholders have little interest or influence in the project. They may require minimal communication and management.</p>
<p>To determine the level of impact stakeholders may have on the project, the team will use tools such as a stakeholder matrix or power/interest grid. These tools will help to identify which stakeholders may require more attention and resources to manage. The stakeholder analysis will also consider the potential risks and benefits associated with each stakeholder group. This will help the team to anticipate any conflicts or competing objectives among stakeholders and develop appropriate strategies to manage them.</p>
<p>Overall, the stakeholder analysis will enable the team to better understand the needs and expectations of each stakeholder group and develop an effective stakeholder management plan that addresses their concerns and supports the successful delivery of the project.</p>


=Scope Management Plan= 
==Introduction==
<p> The purpose of this Project Scope Management Plan is to define the scope management process for the Rams E-Caf project. The plan identifies the roles and responsibilities for managing the project scope, as well as the processes for collecting requirements, defining scope, creating a work breakdown structure, verifying scope, and controlling scope.
</p> 

<ol>
  <li><b>Collect Requirements</b> - The Rams E-Caf project team will identify and document the requirements necessary to meet all project objectives. The project charter and stakeholder register will be used to identify requirements, and the team will collectively discuss the details associated with meeting each requirement. Interviews and follow-on discussions will be conducted to clarify the requirements, and they will be documented in sufficient detail to measure them once the project begins the execution phase.</li>
  <li><b>Define Scope</b> -	The Rams E-Caf project team will develop a detailed project/product description that includes deliverables, assumptions, and constraints. This step will establish the framework within which project work must be performed and will be critical to project success.</li>
  <li><b>Create WBS</b> -	The project team will break down project deliverables into progressively smaller and more manageable components, which at the lowest level are called work packages. This hierarchical structure will allow for more simplicity in scheduling, costing, monitoring, and controlling the project.</li>
  <li><b>Verify Scope</b> - The project team will receive formalized acceptance of all deliverables with the sponsor and/or customer in the verify scope process. </li>
  <li><b>Control Scope</b> - The project team will monitor and control the project/product scope, as well as manage any changes in the scope baseline. Changes may be necessary to the project scope but must be controlled and integrated to prevent scope creep.</li>
</ol>

==Scope Management Approach==
<p>
  Authority and responsibility for the scope management will be helped by the project manager, Corneliani Jon Melo, who will work and communicate closely with the project sponsor, Ms. Bernadette Sison, and the stakeholders such as the food concessionaires.

  The scope of the project will be defined in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary and in the Statement of Work (SOW). These documents outline the project deliverables, tasks, and requirements which will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor and other stakeholders before any work in the development side begins.
  
  The scope of the project will be measured and verified with quality checklists and regular team meetings with the project sponsor. Any deviation from the scope will be addressed during the meeting and through the scope change process.
  
  The scope change process for the Rams E-Caf project will include the submission of a scope change request by the project manager with the final approval being granted by the project sponsor. Every detail included in the scope change request should be reviewed and evaluated to ensure that they align with the project goals and objectives but at the same time, does not negatively impact the project schedule and/or budget.
  
  The final project deliverables will be accepted and approved by the project sposor and the key stakeholders. The project manager on the other hand will be responsible for ensuring that all project requirements have been met. The project will be deemed successful once all of the deliverables have been accepted and any issues have been resolved.
  
</p>

==Role and Responsibilities==
<p>The content above outlines the roles and responsibilities of the key individuals involved in the Rams E-Caf project. Each role has specific responsibilities and is essential to the successful completion of the project. Understanding the roles and responsibilities of each team member is crucial to ensure effective communication and collaboration throughout the project's life cycle. By defining the roles and responsibilities, the project manager can set expectations, delegate tasks, and manage resources efficiently.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Project Manager:</b> The project manager is responsible for leading and managing the project team to achieve the project objectives within the constraints of time, budget, and scope.</li>
  <li><b>Developer/IT Head</b> The responsibility of a developer is to write, test, and maintain code that meets the project's requirements and is of high quality.</li>
  <li><b>UI/UX Designer</b> Responsible for creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces for digital products that meet user needs and business objectives.</li>
  <li><b>Documentation</b> The responsibility of a documentation specialist is to ensure that all project documentation is complete, accurate, and up to date.</li>
  <li><b>Stakeholders</b> Responsible for providing input, feedback, and making critical decisions related to the project to ensure its success.</li>
</ol>

==Scope Definition==
<p>
  The scope definition for the Rams E-Caf project was developed after the requirements were identified and defined during the requirements definition process. Three documents were created during this process, namely Project Charter, Business Case, and a Stakeholder Management Plan. These documents were used as references when defining the project's scope.

  The scope definition process involved developing a detailed description of the project and its deliverables. The Rams E-Caf project aims to create a fully functional e-commerce website for Rams Cafe that will allow customers to purchase food and beverage items online. The deliverables of the project include a functional website, a payment gateway for online transactions, and a user-friendly interface.
  
  To define the project's scope, various tools and techniques were used, such as expert judgment and product analysis. Expert judgment was used to gather inputs from industry experts and stakeholders on the project's requirements and deliverables. Product analysis was done to understand the market trends and competition to ensure that the project meets the customers' demands.
  
</p>

==Project Scope Statement==
<p>
  The project's goal is to address the issues of long wait times, inefficient use of manpower, and the implementation of social distancing guidelines by the IATF in the APC cafeteria with the development of an alternative online ordering system. The project will deliver a functional web application that meets the requirements of the stakeholders and improves the overall cafeteria experience for the APC community which consists of students, staff, and faculty members. The successful completion of the project will be measured by user satisfaction, decreased wait times, increased efficiency for the cafeteria's food concessionaires, and adherence to social distancing guidelines, as well as avoid the long queues with also achieving to process food with a timely manner.
 
  The users will only focus on the APC community and will not include non-APC community and non-APC concessionaires. The project will not include creating a native mobile application hence its infrastructure will be web-based and will be available through most browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Firefox. This will only be accessible by having an internet connection hence the project will only focus on this and will exclude problems of having no internet connection. Additionally, the focus solution is to digitalize the ordering system of APC cafeteria and will not interfere changing the lunch time or break time of the APC community, as well as all other solutions.
  
  Furthermore, the project will be supported by the APC by providing monitors or tablets depending on the chosen devices by the concessionaires thus there is no technology constraint. However, the project is subject to budget constraints, as it depends on approval from the project sponsor. Time is also a constraint, as the project must be completed by the end of the term and deliverables must be completed on schedule. The project must deliver a fully functional web application that meets the requirements of the stakeholders and is accepted by them as complete within the available resources and timeline.
  
  The successful completion of the project is based on shared assumptions between the project team and stakeholders. It is assumed that both parties understand the requirements and objectives of the project, and the project team has the technical capability and access to resources to develop and implement the online web application and it is assumed that both parties have agreed on the scope of the project. Moreover, the project team and stakeholders are committed to complying with all relevant laws, rules and regulations, guidelines, including those related to data privacy and security. Consequently, the importance of social distancing and other safety measures to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 is understood, and the implementation of the web application is assumed to aid these measures.

==Work Breakdown Structure==
<p>
  Scope management is a critical aspect of project management that involves defining, documenting, and controlling the project's boundaries. One of the essential tools for effective scope management is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), which is used to break down the project scope into smaller, manageable components. The WBS is then used to create the WBS Dictionary, which provides detailed information on the work packages, activities, and tasks required to complete each component. In this section, we will discuss how the project scope for Rams E-Caf will be subdivided into smaller deliverables in the WBS and WBS Dictionary and how these components will be managed during the project's life cycle.

<p>By following this scope control plan, the project team can ensure that the project remains within the defined boundaries and is completed within the set timeframe and budget.</p>

=Cost Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>
  In broader terms, the Rams E-Caf project's cost management plan is created to make sure that all project expenses are efficiently handled and kept under control, allowing the project to be finished within the allocated budget. This will make it more likely that the project will be successfully and promptly finished.
 
  Cost Management Responsibilities
  ·	The Project Manager oversees the project's overall cost management and serves as the point of contact for any potential costing problems.
  ·	The finance team oversees making sure that the project's approved budget is being monitored.
   
  Cost Measurement and Reporting
  ·	Using a cost performance index (CPI) and a schedule performance index (SPI), costs will be tracked and reported.
  Cost Change Approval
  ·	Before making and putting into effect the following adjustments to the cost management, the project manager must give his or her approval.
  ·	The Project Sponsor must be consulted and given approval before any changes to the costing or budget are made.
  Budget Format and Standards
  ·	A spreadsheet will be used to present the budgets and plot them in depth.
  ·	If there are updates or adjustments to the costings, the budgets will be noted.

This will make it more likely that the project will be successfully and promptly finished.
</p> 

==Cost Management Approach==
<p>
  The following guiding concepts will serve as the foundation for the Rams E-Caf project's cost management strategy:

1.	Costs are defined clearly:
    To properly identify and document project costs, including labor, materials, equipment, and other expenses, the project team will collaborate closely with stakeholders.
2.	Budget creation and monitoring:
    Costs will be tracked and reported in real time, and a thorough project budget will be created and frequently updated throughout the project.
3.	Cost projections:
    To make sure that the project budget is precise and reasonable, the project team will employ a range of cost estimation approaches.
4.	Cost variance analysis:
		The project team will do variance analysis to find and rectify any cost overruns or savings while keeping a tight eye on expenses throughout the project.
5.	Cost management roles and responsibilities:
		All project team members will be informed of the precise roles and duties for cost management.
6.	Approval process for changes:
		A formal procedure for approving adjustments to the project's budget will be developed and put into place.
7.	Reporting and communication:
    Regular cost reports will be created and distributed to all parties involved, such as the project sponsor, project team, and management.

</p>


==Measuring Project Cost==
<p>
  A specific method for applying Earned Value Management (EVM) to measure project costs will be included in the Cost Management Plan for the Rams E-Caf project. A specific method for applying Earned Value Management (EVM) to measure project costs will be included in the Cost Management Plan for the Rams E-Caf. This will entail keeping track of and releasing numerous Earned Value signs, including:
 
  1.	The budgeted expenses of the work that was anticipated to be finished at a particular period are measured using the terms Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV).
      The total labor expense for the TESTING WBS must be multiplied by the percentage of completion for the WBS to determine the BCWS or Planned Value:
  
  BCWS = Total labor cost of TESTING WBS x Percentage of completion
  = (PHP 84,317.25) x 33.71%
  = PHP 28,423.34
   
  
  As a result, the Planned Value (PV) or Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) for the TESTING WBS Is PHP 28,423.34
  
  
  2.	 Earned Value (EV) or Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) is a measure of the estimated price of the work that has been finished at a particular period.
   
  Example:
   
  The proportion of work completed for each job or WBS element is necessary to determine the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV). Assuming that each Testing phase task has been completed to a certain percentage:
   
  Week 40: Testing Phase 1 - 100%
  Week 41: Testing Phase 2 - 75%
  Week 42: Testing Phase 3 - 50%
  Week 43: Testing Phase 4 - 25%
   
  The Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV) can then be determined as follows:
   
  EV = BCWS (*) % of work completed
  EV = (₱ 84,317.25 x 33.71%) + (₱28,059 x 8.43% x 0.75) + (₱ 28,059 x 8.43% x 0.50) + (₱28,059 x 8.43% x 0.25)
  EV = ₱28,423.34+ ₱1,774.03+ ₱1,182.69+ ₱591.34
  EV = ₱ 31971.4
  
   
  As a result, the Earned Value (EV) or Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) is ₱31971.4
  
  This estimate was only based on the research of the proponent and article on getastra.
 </p>       


==Reporting Format==
<p>
  A thorough spreadsheet or table would likely be the best reporting format for the expense management strategy of the Rams E-Caf service project. The project's budget, actual costs incurred, expected costs, and any variations or inconsistencies ought to all be included in this format.
  The project team, stakeholders, and management should all be able to access the format and understand it without difficulty. To give the expense information a visual representation, a bar chart or Gantt chart can also be used. The following components would be part of the reporting format for the Rams E-Caf project's cost management plan:
</p>  


<p>
1.Executive Summary:<br>
An outline of the project's overall budget, any significant cost issues or variations, and 	any steps taken to address them is included in the cost management plan.<br>

2.Budget Overview:<br>
A thorough financial breakdown includes the project's overall cost, the price of each 	phase or deliverable, and the price of each project resource (such as personnel, supplies, 	equipment, etc.).<br>

3.Cost Variance Analysis:<br>
A thorough examination of discrepancies between the project's estimated and actual 	costs. This should thoroughly justify the deviations' causes, their effects on the project, and any steps taken to address them.<br>

4.Budget Forecast:<br>
A projection of the project's future costs, including any potential cost variances and their potential impact on the project. <br>

5.Cost Management Metrics:<br>
A forecast of the project's foreseeable costs, considering any probable cost variations 	and their potential influence on the undertaking.<br>

6.Approval and Sign-off:<br>
The part where the cost management strategy is reviewed, approved, and signed off on by 	the project's manager and other major stakeholders.<br>

7.Appendices:<br>
Any more records or materials, including invoices, change request forms, and 	comprehensive cost breakdowns.<br>

</p>

==Cost Variance Response Process==
<p>
  The Control Thresholds for this project is a CPI or SPI of less than 0.8 or greater than 1.2.  If the project reaches one of these Control Thresholds a Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan is required.  The Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with options for corrective actions within five business days from when the cost variance is first reported.  Within three business days from when the Project Sponsor selects a corrective action option, the Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with a formal Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan.  The Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan will detail the actions necessary to bring the project back within budget and the means by which the effectiveness of the actions in the plan will be measured.  Upon acceptance of the Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan it will become a part of the project plan and the project will be updated to reflect the corrective actions.

==Cost Change Control Process==
<p>
  The following steps will be part of the cost change control process:
 
  Identification of the cost change:
  1.	A cost change request form must be used to identify and record any suggested modifications to the project's costs or budget.
  2.	Analysis of the cost change:
      The project team will evaluate the proposed modification and determine its possible impact on the project's budget, resources, and timeline.
   
  3.	Approval of the cost change:
      The project sponsor and other relevant stakeholders are going to review and authorize the request for a cost change.
                                      
  4.	Implementation of the cost change:
      Upon approval, the cost adjustment will be carried out in accordance with the	project's budget and schedule.
   
  5.	Tracking and monitoring of the cost change:
      The project team will keep tabs on how the cost change will affect the project's budget and schedule and make any required adjustments to keep things on track.
   
  6.	Reporting on the cost change:
      The project status report will include the cost change, any pertinent financial data, and any corrective actions that were implemented.
   
  The expense change control procedure will be implemented to make sure that any alterations to the project budget or expenses are quickly found, assessed, and approved. By doing this, you may lessen the effect of cost fluctuations on the project's budget and schedule and help to keep it on pace to achieve its goals.

=Time Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>
  The Schedule Management Plan is an important document that outlines the approach and procedures developing, monitoring, controlling, and reporting on the project schedule. The purpose of this plan is to ensure that the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required level of quality. A well-planned schedule management plan is crucial to achieve the succession of the project as it enables the project team to track progress against the project timeline, potential delays or issues and take corrective action.
  <br>
  This plan will describe in detail the schedule management approach that will be used to create the project schedule, the procedures for monitoring and controlling the schedule throughout the project lifecycle, as well as the process for making schedule changes and managing scope changes. It will also define the roles and responsibilities of the project team members involved in schedule management and the tools and techniques that will be used to manage the schedule.
</p>

==Schedule Management Approach==
<p>The project schedules will be created using Microsoft Project as the scheduling tool/format with the deliverables identified in the project’s Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). This will provide a visual representation of the project schedule including start and end dates of each task, dependencies, and milestones. The project schedule will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis to ensure that it remains accurate and up to date.

  Schedule milestones will be established to provide the team with a clear understanding of major project deliverables and deadlines. The following will be the milestones for the project schedule:

<p>The team will work collaboratively to develop and update the project schedule, with each member responsible for their assigned tasks and providing regular status updates. The schedule will be reviewed and updated regularly by the Project Manager to ensure that it remains accurate and up to date.</p>

==Schedule Control==
<p>The Rams E-Caf project schedule will be monitored and controlled throughout the project life cycle to ensure that the project is progressing according to the plan. The following schedule control activities will be performed:</p>

<p>Schedule Updates: The project schedule will be updated on a regular basis to reflect the latest project status. The project manager will be responsible for updating the schedule, and the updated schedule will be shared with the project team and stakeholders.</p>

<p>Schedule Reviews: The project team will conduct regular schedule reviews to identify potential schedule risks and issues. The reviews will be conducted on a weekly basis, and any significant issues will be escalated to the Project Manager for resolution.</p>

<p>Schedule Communication: The project schedule will be communicated to the project team and stakeholders on a regular basis to ensure that everyone is aware of the project’s progress. The Project Manager will be responsible for communicating the schedule, and any changes to the schedule will be communicated promptly to all relevant parties.</p>

<p>Roles and Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Project Manager is responsible for updating the project schedule, conducting regular schedule reviews, and communicating the schedule to the project team and stakeholders.</li>
  <li>The Project team members are responsible for providing accurate status updates and notifying the Project Manager of any potential schedule risks or issues.</li>
  <li>Stakeholders are responsible for reviewing the project schedule and providing feedback to the Project Manager.</li>
</ul>

<p>To implement these schedule control activities, the Rams E-Caf project team will be able to proactively manage the project schedule potential schedule risks and ensure that the project is completed on time.</p>


==Schedule Changes and Thresholds==
<p>
  The Rams E-Caf project schedule will be created based on the best available information at the time of development. As the project progresses, it is expected that there may be changes to the project schedule. Any changes to the project schedule must be requested and approved by the Project Sponsor before the changes are made.

To ensure that the project stays on track, threshold limits have been set. Any change to the schedule that exceeds the threshold limit must have a schedule change request submitted and approved by the project sponsor before the schedule change is made. The threshold limit for this project has been set at 10%. This means that any schedule change that results in a delay of 10% or more from the original schedule baseline must have a schedule change request submitted and approved by the project sponsor.

The project team is responsible for monitoring the schedule on an ongoing basis and reporting any schedule changes or potential delays to the project sponsor. The project sponsor will review and approve or deny any schedule change requests based on their impact on the project budget, resources, and overall project objectives.

</p>

==Scope Change==
<p>
  Occasionally, changes to the project scope may be necessary and approved by the project sponsor. These changes may result in the schedule needing to be re-baselined to ensure that it accurately reflects the project’s new scope. Examples of scope changes may include new deliverables or requirements that were not previously considered during the original schedule’s development.

In these situations, the Project Manager and the team must carefully evaluate the impact of the scope change on the project schedule and its resources. The project team should also consider any additional time and resources that may be required to complete the project, as well as the potential impact on other project constraints such as cost and quality.

Furthermore, before implementing any scope changes, the project team must ensure that the project sponsor approves the change request and that a corresponding schedule change request is submitted and approved. The project manager and team must update the project schedule to reflect any approved scope changes and ensure that all stakeholders are informed of the changes and their impact on the project’s schedule.

=Work Breakdown Structure=

==Introduction==
<p>The Apelo Dental Clinic System has the main goal to lessen the waiting time of the patients through queueing management, digitalization of patient’s dental records, and automating several manual processes to improve the clinic’s performance. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for Apelo Dental Clinic System outlines the various work packages that must be accomplished to deliver a functional and user-friendly e-commerce web application. The WBS presents the project scope and helps in defining the deliverables that must be accomplished to meet the project objectives. This document will provide an overview of the WBS layout for Apelo Dental Clinic System.</p>
<br>
<p>The WBS is organized into five major phases, which include project planning, analysis and design, development, documentation, and development II. Each phase is further broken down into several sub-phases or work packages, which are numbered for easy reference. The WBS has been designed to accommodate the key stakeholders, including the project owner, Doctor Denroe Apelo. Doctor Apelo will have the opportunity to review the WBS to ensure that the project goals are being met, and any adjustments can be made before the project progresses too far.</p>
<br>
<p>Overall, the WBS for Apelo Dental Clinic System provides a comprehensive view of the tasks needed to deliver a fully-functional e-commerce web application. It is an essential tool that helps the project team in tracking and monitoring the progress of the project, ensuring that it is delivered on time and to the satisfaction of the stakeholders.</p>
<br>

==Outline View==

<br>

==Risk Management Plan==
==Introduction==
<p>
  The Rams E-Caf: A Cafeteria Management System, aims to provide a system for the Asia Pacific College Cafeteria.
  The risk management plan includes an outline of the risk management process, the project team's duties and responsibilities, and the plan for risk assessments. The strategy will also outline the methods for managing and monitoring risks as well as the strategies for handling them. The efficiency of the plan will be evaluated by how quickly threats are found and addressed.
</p>

==Top Three Risks==
<ul>
  <li>The Rams E-Caf will not be accessed by the customers if the customers have no internet connection.</li>
  <li>The risk of connection interruption in the middle of payment process done with the use of payment gateways inside the Rams E-Caf web application.</li>
  <li>The unsynchronized stocks/available food amount displayed in the web application and the physical food stall may cause confusion and conflict.</li>
</ul>

==Risk Management Approach==
<ol>
  <li>Risk Identification and Assessment: The project team will identify project-related dangers through brainstorming sessions, research into previous project experiences, and appraisal of the project's requirements and scope. A risk registry will contain a list of the dangers as well as information on their description, potential impacts, and likelihood of occurrence. The risks that have been identified will be evaluated in terms of both their likelihood of happening and their impact on the project. Using the risk matrix, the project team will assess each risk according to its seriousness. High severity risks will be given priority for either contingency planning or mitigation.</li>
  <li>Risk Monitoring: Throughout the project, risks will be regularly watched for. The project team will periodically examine the risk register to make sure that risks are being managed appropriately. The risk assessment procedure will be repeated as new threats are discovered and added to the risk register during the project.</li>
  <li>Risk Mitigation: For hazards with a high effect and likelihood of occurrence, risk mitigation plans will be devised. The mitigation plans will contain risk-mitigation techniques. In addition, the project team will choose backup strategies for hazards that cannot be eliminated.</li>
  <li>Risk Communication: The process of informing relevant parties—such as the project sponsor, the project team, and other stakeholders—about risks and associated management techniques is known as risk communication. The project team will keep all stakeholders informed and continue frequent communication if any risks are found, evaluated, and dealt with.</li>
</ol>

==Risk Identification==
<p>
  The Rams E-Caf project utilized expert interviews, historical data analysis, and a risk assessment conference to identify and document risks. A risk register was created, containing descriptions, potential impact, and likelihood of occurrence. The project team and stakeholders participated in a risk assessment meeting, contributing to the identification and assessment of risks. The team also reviewed historical information and conducted expert interviews to identify additional risks and develop mitigation strategies. The identified risks are regularly updated in an Agile risk management plan to ensure effective risk management throughout the project. The following are a few of the project's potential risks for the Rams E-Caf project:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Human Error: Admin’s computer or devices that have access to the database of APC student’s information in the Rams E-Caf might be left open due to negligence which could leave the data open for anyone in the area to access.</li>
  <li>Security Vulnerabilities: The initiative runs the risk of being exposed to security lapses or data loss, both of which might have dire repercussions.</li>
  <li>Unforeseen Circumstances: There is a chance that unanticipated events (such market shifts) could have an unexpected effect on the project. The payment gateway company goes inactive or loses connection in the middle of payment.</li>
</ul>

==Risk Qualification and Prioritization==
<p>
  The project team will regularly review and update the risk record to make sure that risks are prioritized appropriately. The risks mentioned in the risk records were classified and evaluated using a probability-impact matrix. Risks that would have a significant effect on the project and a high possibility of occurring were given top consideration. Determine the probability and impact of each risk after analyzing potential risks related to Rams E-Caf business case. Following is an overview of the likelihood of risks and their effects on the project:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extreme: Risks that could seriously harm the project and have a very high possibility of happening.</li>
  <li>High: Risks that could have a big impact on the project and have a high chance of happening. The team must immediately address these risks and create mitigation plans for them.</li>
  <li>Medium: Risks that have an average chance of happening and a fair impact on the project. To prepare for these risks, mitigation plans should be created, and these risks should be continuously monitored.</li>
  <li>Low: Risks that have a small impact on the project and a low likelihood of occurring. Periodically monitoring these risks will allow for the development of mitigation plans in case they occur.</li>
  <li>Negligible: Risks that have little chance of happening and little effect on the project. These dangers can be disregarded.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://ibb.co/c8JSrBW"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/QH93KgW/Risk-Matrix.png" alt="Risk-Matrix" border="0"></a><br /><a target='_blank'</a><br />

  <li>Technical Risks:
    <ul>
      <li>High probability and high impact</li>
      <li>Lack of technical expertise to develop the system</li>
      <li>Failure of the new system to integrate with the current systems</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resource Risks:
    <ul>
      <li>Medium probability and medium impact</li>
      <li>Inadequate resources for the project</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Security Risks:
    <ul>
      <li>Medium probability and medium impact</li>
      <li>Unauthorized access to the system</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

==Risk Qualification and Prioritization==
<p>
  The project team will regularly review and update the risk record to make sure that risks are prioritized appropriately. The risks mentioned in the risk records were classified and evaluated using a probability-impact matrix. Risks that would have a significant effect on the project and a high possibility of occurring were given top consideration. Determine the probability and impact of each risk after analyzing potential risks related to Rams E-Caf business case.

  <li>Negligible: Risks that have little chance of happening and little effect on the project. These dangers can be disregarded.</li>
</ul>

==6.9.6 Risk Monitoring==
<p>
  The Rams E-Caf Agile Risk Management Plan offers a framework for actively tracking risks throughout the project. To do this, it is crucial to closely document the process, including defining the circumstances that might set off risks, and to regularly monitor risks during the project.
</p>
<p>
  The high-scoring risks will be incorporated into the project schedule, and the risk manager will be given responsibility for their monitoring. This will make it easier for the project manager to decide when hazards need to be closely monitored and when the risk manager should provide project team meetings with updates. The risk manager will oversee monitoring the risk trigger circumstances. The project manager will also make sure that the project team is informed of the risks that have been identified and their potential effects on the project. Any new risks or modifications to existing risks should be reported to the risk management by the project team so that they can be evaluated and given the appropriate level of priority.
</p>
<p>
  The project team will employ the agile risk management technique, which places an emphasis on adaptability and continuous development. The effectiveness of the risk management plan will be reevaluated as needed to ensure that the project's objectives and quality requirements are satisfied.
</p>

==6.9.7 Risk Mitigation and Avoidance==
<p>
  The risk management strategy will be created by the project team based on the weight each risk is given. Identification and prioritization of potential hazards is the first step in risk mitigation and avoidance. Alternative plans, greater resources, or a change in project deadlines are possible preparation techniques for expected delays. The project team should identify the risks that are most likely to occur and have the greatest potential impact, and then develop methods to lessen or eliminate those risks. The project manager has the following main factors and choices to think about:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resource Allocation: The project manager must make sure the team has the necessary resources, including competence, abilities, and expertise, as well as access to tools and equipment, for the project to be effective and efficient. The project manager oversees making sure that the team has access to these resources to complete the project on schedule and within the allocated budget.</li>
  <li>Risk Assessment: To effectively estimate and handle potential hazards, the team should do a detailed analysis of them. Early in the project, the risk assessment should be finished, and the project manager should move quickly to identify and reduce any potential risks.</li>
  <li>Contingency Planning: The project team must develop backup plans for emergencies to be ready for potential dangers. The project manager is responsible for supervising the creation, validation, and testing of these strategies for each potential risk.</li>
  <li>Agile Approach: Risk management can be done in a flexible and quick manner by using the Agile methodology. The team's use of the Agile methodology, which permits continual risk management and the capacity for change, must be ensured by the project manager.</li>
  <li>Communication: The project manager must encourage open and transparent communication between the project team, clients, and stakeholders to reduce risks and avoid misunderstandings.</li>
</ul>

==6.9.8 Risk Register==
<p>
  The risk register, which will be kept up to date throughout the project, will include comprehensive explanations of each risk, its likelihood, potential effects, and any mitigating measures. To ensure that it appropriately reflects the project's current situation, the risk register will be constantly reviewed and updated. All interested parties will have access to the risk register, which will be kept in a centralized location.
</p>
<p>
  This risk management approach emphasizes early and frequent risk discovery, collaborative risk management, and ongoing risk monitoring, which is frequently in line with the Agile methodology. The Rams E-Caf project team, Coderist, can lessen the effects and raise the possibility that the project will be successful by anticipating and resolving any hazards. The following criteria will serve as the basis for the risk register:

    Evaluation of contractual agreements:
    <p>Existing contractual agreements pertaining to intellectual property ownership and transfer will be carefully reviewed and assessed to ensure compliance throughout the transition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Negotiation of new agreements:
    <p>If any gaps or inconsistencies are identified in the existing agreements, new agreements will be negotiated among the incumbent, new contractor, and the customer to ensure proper ownership and transfer of all intellectual property.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Protection of intellectual property:
    <p>During the transition period, all necessary measures, such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and other legal safeguards, will be implemented to safeguard the intellectual property from unauthorized disclosure or use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer of intellectual property:
    <p>Upon the successful completion of the transition process, all relevant intellectual property will be transferred in accordance with the contractual agreements in place. This may involve transferring the intellectual property to the new contractor, the customer, or retaining it with the incumbent, as specified in the contracts.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>By following these steps, the Rams E-Caf Project can ensure a smooth and secure transition of all intellectual property related to the project.</p>

==User Accounts and Passwords==
<p>As part of our transition plan for the Rams E-Caf project, we recognize the importance of ensuring a seamless transfer of user accounts and passwords. The following steps and considerations outline how we will handle this aspect of the transition:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    User Account Inventory:
    <p>Begin by creating a comprehensive inventory of all user accounts and their associated privileges. This inventory should encompass both internal and external users, including system administrators, third-party vendors, and end users.
    It is important to identify and specify which accounts are no longer active or necessary for the system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Password Security:
    <p>Ensure robust security during the transition process by resetting or disabling all user passwords. This step is essential to prevent unauthorized access to the system and its data.
    Notify users before the transition and instruct them to change their passwords to a temporary one provided to them. The new contractor or system owner should enforce the creation of new, secure passwords by all users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Account Transition and Disablement:
    <p>After addressing the inventory and password security measures, the next step involves identifying which accounts will be transitioned and which ones will be disabled.
    Clearly outline the individuals responsible for overseeing the smooth transfer of accounts and passwords.
    In cases where accounts are to be disabled, provide detailed procedures for promptly revoking access rights for terminated employees, contractors, or third-party vendors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Table of User Accounts:
    <p>Include a comprehensive table in the transition plan listing all user accounts earmarked for transition or disablement.
    This table should include important information such as the username, associated email address, and corresponding privileges or access rights.
    Additionally, specify whether the account will be transitioned or disabled and provide any specific instructions for the transition process.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, ensuring the seamless transfer of user accounts and passwords is a critical aspect of the Rams E-Caf's property transition plan within the Rams E-Caf framework. By following a systematic approach that includes creating an inventory, implementing password security measures, establishing clear procedures for account transition and disablement, and providing a comprehensive table of user accounts, a smooth and secure transition can be achieved.</p>
