# Business Case
## Executive Summary
lorem ipsum

### Issue
The issue that arises as a business problem for our client is the decline in sales following the recent pandemic which caused our client to shut down their business for more than 5 months. Not only that but after the pandemic, other businesses started to adapt with innovative technologies and marketing opportunities as businesses were able to cope with changes that benefited the growth of their sales and market through integrating online tools which our client has not maximized and thus resulting to their decline in sales and lack of customer reach.

### Anticipated Outcomes
Once the project has been implemented, this will by leading to more customer interaction with their business as the online store will add credibility and improve the customer’s online experience and it will also lead into more sales as more orders can be processed at a time with the help of the ordering system. 

The project’s end state will be operated and monitored by the client and will run smoothly as they continue to incorporate their products online and cater to the customer needs faster and in a more convenient manner.

### Recommendation
The team addresses the business’ problem by creating a system or an online store which will help the business improve. In a matter of time and client decision, the system may be upgraded, and more features could be added apart from the general features that are needed for the first deployment of the system.

### Justification
Applying the system created for Villamin Wood and Iron Works will increase the possibility of expanding their customer reach and increase product sales in comparison to their initial use of Facebook Page. This ordering system will help customers order their desired products even when they are at home or at their workplace. It will provide easy communication between the customer and the client, and an easy transaction for the products or items, this will help Villamin Wood and Iron Works gain more customers and increase their sales continuously without errors or problems. However, this system will not replace their initial page in Facebook, but rather it will help the system to be more advertised and seen by other potential customers.

## Alternatives Analysis
There are other alternatives that the team has put into consideration for the Business's concern. Listed are those alternative solutions alongside with why the team did not lean towards it: <br>
1. Focus on the current business process.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Though the company and its employees have grown accustomed to their current practice, this method could impose a threat compared to their competitors. As other competitors innovate their way through online platforms, they also increase their chances of attracting customers, and have a well-documented process. If the company were to disregard innovation in marketing, they might find it more difficult to market what they are selling and rely only on what was written. </p>
2. Enhance the company's Facebook page.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> The client already has a Facebook page, but this limits them from customizing their page in a way that may help them introduce their company to the mass public. </p>
3. Sell products through available ecommerce websites.

# Project Charter Plan
## Executive Summary
Since 1983, our company, Villamin Wood & Iron Works, has proven the durability of the products. But they lack customer reach and sales. Due to that problem, Villamin Wood & Iron Works System has been created to help reach out to more customers, not only through on-shop, but also through online, which will also help increase the company’s sales. The project is being created as a solution and in line with the current ordering system to accomplish both the customer and company’s needs.

## Project Purpose/Justification
### Business Need/Case
The Villamin Wood & Iron Works System has been created to help the company increase their sales and customer reach to take back the loss in income from the sudden temporary closing of shop due to the pandemic. Also, to enhance the conveniency of their customers. In this approach, it will eliminate unnecessary expenses of the company. The cost to make the system successful will be covered by the company owner, recovered by the system's anticipated results.
Business Objectives 
### Business Objectives 
1. Strengthen customer service.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> Develop goals that motivate them and ensure that our customers and clients have a positive experience with our services. And emphasize the importance of providing an exceptional customer experience every time we connect with our customers and clients. </p>
2. Sell a more reliable product.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> Our company will set quality and troubleshooting goals to identify areas for improvement within our products. With this, we will be able to give constant enhancements and upgrades based on the demands of our clients. </p>

## Project Description
The Villamin Wood & Iron Works System will support the increase in the company’s sales and customer reach. The system will provide easy navigation and transaction to avoid complications while the system is being used by customers. The system will be an additional tool from the company’s current platform to attain their objectives while allowing customers to browse and process orders easily.

### Project Objectives and Success Criteria
#### Constraints
These are the following constraints pertain to Villamin Wood and Iron works: <br>
1. It is necessary to purchase if there are any additional requirements within the allocated budget and time limit. <br>
2. The stakeholder will provide the necessary information for the project. <br>
3. The software to be used must be suitable for our IT (Information Technology) platforms.
#### Assumptions
1. There will be communication between the team and the company if there are complications occur upon deployment. <br>
2. If there are more resources, the company and the team will discuss.

## Preliminary Scope Statement
This project created by the MLNSD team will include designing, improving, testing and delivery of an improved online ordering system for the client, Villamin Wood & Iron Works. The improved system will require internet use to capture the orders and training of the client's staff to manage and administer the website. The project will conclude once the system is ready for deployment.

## Risks
The following risks are what the team has foreseen that could affect the performance output of the project proposed: <br>
1. Denial of service <br> <br>
&nbsp; a. Web Services that are not accessible to the users, render potential loss of profit. <br>
&nbsp; b. A factor that causes Denial of Service is web traffic entering the system. When the system has received user requests beyond its capacity, it may lead to a system crash. <br>
&nbsp; c. Malicious attacks also play a role. In which hackers flood/overflow the request, impair the servers, and cause inoperability. <br>
&nbsp; d. Not only will customers suffer from the system's malfunction caused by external factors, but the company's workforce will not be able to complete the tasks required to fulfill the needed output. <br> <br> 
2. SQL injections <br> <br>
&nbsp; a. Hackers use this technique to alter the desired algorithm (within the source code) by the developers. This in return gives more control to them. It also increases the company's system vulnerabilities. <br> <br>
3. Data breach <br> <br>
&nbsp; a. Data breach is a process of hackers collecting data without any form of authorization from the product owners. The data can be used to damage the company and its stakeholder's reputation for the benefit of the infiltrator. <br>
&nbsp; b. Despite having numerous methods of attacks (such as, insider leak, loss or theft of information, and unintended disclosure), the prior risks may also be a factor that may contribute to this. <br> <br>
4. Cybersquatting <br> <br>
&nbsp; a. Cybersquatting is a way for external affairs to take advantage of the websites' domain. <br>
&nbsp; b. Cybersquatters manipulate the reputation and domain of the company and use it to redirect users to a different service and/or platform.

<p> With the listed risks, the team will collaborate with the stakeholders and ensure that the foreseen risks will be tended to. In preparation to reinforce the project based on the risks listed, the team will create solutions that are aligned with the project budget and constraints. If the risks were to affect the system, the team will ensure this is handled with immediate response. </p>

## Project Deliverables
Following the project's successful conclusion, the following deliverables must be met. These deliverables cannot be altered without the project sponsor's consent. <br>
1. Product <br>
2. Logo <br>

# Scope Management Plan
## Introduction
<p>The Villamin Wood and Iron Works System plan for scope management describes the technologies and resources that will be used to create, document, and handle the project's context. Agile methodologies and collaborative tools will be utilized by the team to build an ordering system that meets the project's demands. </p>

1. Collect Requirements – In order to gather and record the system's requirements, the project team will employ a variety of methods, including client interviews and discussions. <br>

2. Define Scope – To establish the scope, the user stories and scope statement will be integrated into a project management plan. The plan will be revised periodically to accommodate any modifications in the project's scope during its advancement. <br>

3. Verify Scope – The project group will utilize an agile methodology to test and confirm that the expectations of the undertaking meet the necessities and line up with the scope statement. <br>

4. Control Scope – A formal change control process will be used to manage any changes to the project's scope. This process will look at how these changes will affect the project's schedule, budget, and quality. Additionally, each change solicitation guarantees that the change is fundamental, practical, and lined up with the project objectives. <br>

5. Create WBS – this process breaks project deliverables down into progressively smaller and more manageable components which, at the lowest level, are called work packages.  This hierarchical structure allows for more simplicity in scheduling, costing, monitoring, and controlling the project. <br>

## Scope Management Approach
<p>The Project Manager, Mabelle Aspeli, will have the authority and responsibility to manage scope management. Mabelle Aspeli will collaborate with the project sponsor, Mr. Manuel Villamin Jr, to establish and regulate the project's scope. </p>

1. The extent of the project will be assessed and confirmed by reports, frequent assessments of the project's advancement in comparison to the initial scope, and evaluation of the project's performance. If there are any variations from the initial scope, they will be identified and resolved through the scope change procedure. <br> <br>
2. Throughout the Villamin Wood and Iron Works process, the scope of the project will change, the Project Manager will have to accommodate a change request, and the project sponsor will give the final approval. To ensure that they align with the project objective and do not adversely affect the schedule or budget, any changes to the project scope must be thoroughly evaluated. <br> <br>
3. It is the duty of the Project Manager to make sure that all project requirements have been met so that the final deliverables are accepted and approved by the stakeholder and the project sponsor. Once all the deliverables are accepted and any remaining issues are resolved, the successful completion of the project will be confirmed.

## Roles and Responsibilities
1. Project Manager – It is the responsibility of the Project Manager to manage and authorize modifications to the project's scope, as well as to establish and record the project's scope. <br>
2. Project Sponsor – Project Sponsor will have the authority to approve all changes, particularly in project budget, schedule, and project scope. <br>
3. Project Team - The project team’s responsibility is to verify the scope of the project and to ask any relevant questions regarding modifications that have been submitted. <br>
4. Stakeholder - Stakeholders are responsible for providing their insights into the project's requirements and scope as well as authorizing any necessary changes to the scope. <br>

## Scope Definition
<p>The team developed the project Villamin Wood and Iron Works System to build a system that resolves all the issues presented by the client and to meet their demands which includes the following: </p>

1. Creating an Ordering System in the online store to address the conflicts with their manual ordering process. <br> 
2. Increasing the customer reach. <br>
3. Monitor the inventory of stocks and orders. <br>

<p>The process of developing the detailed description of this project and its deliverables occurred through interviewing with the client and learning about their business process and understanding their struggles and how we can contribute to their business by providing the project. Team meetings discussing and developing a plan is an important process in the development of the project as we identified all requirements, scope of the project, and how we can incorporate our ideas into the system. </p>

## Project Scope Statement
1. Product Scope Description – The project will accomplish all requests made by the client based on the business problems they have provided which should be solved by the project. <br>
2. Product Acceptance Criteria – Part of the acceptance criteria will be based on the overall satisfaction of the client. This can be broken down into specific parts which includes the deployment of a fully functioning online store, solving all the presented business problems, and catering to the needs of the customers through the online store. <br>
3. Project Deliverables <br>
4. Project Exclusions <br>
5. Project Constraints <br> 
The following limits the project: <br>
&nbsp; a. Limited budget <br>
&nbsp; b. Availability of tools to use. <br>
&nbsp; c. Manpower <br>
6. Project Assumptions

## Work Breakdown Structure
lorem ipsum

## Scope Verification
<p>In ensuring that the deliverables are verified leading to the formal acceptance of the project, the team will use the following methods for scope verification: </p>

1. Quality checklists
&nbsp; <p>This list will check that the requirements are being fulfilled and verify that they pass the standards to advance to the next deliverable. </p>

2. Work performance measurements
&nbsp; <p>The team will keep track of the progress of every deliverable, assuring that every member is contributing and fulfilling their roles in the development of the project. </p>

3. Scope baseline
&nbsp; <p>This is used to ensure that the deliverables will meet the scope and make sure that it maintains the original project scope despite changes being implemented. </p>

4. Formal Acceptance
&nbsp; <p> The acceptance of both the project sponsor, other stakeholders and the team is needed for the completion. This ensures that the team has met the demands and expectations of the client. That is why it is essential that there are consistent meetings and communications to ensure that the project and deliverables go as planned. </p>

## Scope Control
<p>As part of the scope control process, the project's progress and outcomes will be evaluated on a regular basis to make sure they still adhere to the project scope that is stated in the Project Scope Statement. Any deviations from the scope will be assessed, and if fundamental, the changes in the scope will be documented and still follow the procedure in the existing scope. Monitoring and managing will be the responsibility of 
the project manager alongside the team and stakeholders. The project manager will be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure that the project progress is still being followed. </p>

<p>The following steps will be taken to modify the scope baseline during the scope control process for the Villamin Wood and Iron Works System project: <p>

1. The request for a change in scope will be evaluated by the Project Manager and the Project Sponsor to assess its potential impact on the project schedule, financial plan, and available resources. <br>
2. Any stakeholder or team member who identifies a requirement for a change to the scope will initiate a scope change request. <br>
3. If the request is approved, the Project Manager will create a plan of action to implement the change, revise the initial project scope, and communicate the change to all relevant stakeholders. <br>
4. The project team will continue with the original scope if the request is rejected. <br>
