# Business Case
## Executive Summary
lorem ipsum

### Issue
The issue that arises as a business problem for our client is the decline in sales following the recent pandemic which caused our client to shut down their business for more than 5 months. Not only that but after the pandemic, other businesses started to adapt with innovative technologies and marketing opportunities as businesses were able to cope with changes that benefited the growth of their sales and market through integrating online tools which our client has not maximized and thus resulting to their decline in sales and lack of customer reach.

### Anticipated Outcomes
Once the project has been implemented, this will by leading to more customer interaction with their business as the online store will add credibility and improve the customer’s online experience and it will also lead into more sales as more orders can be processed at a time with the help of the ordering system. 

The project’s end state will be operated and monitored by the client and will run smoothly as they continue to incorporate their products online and cater to the customer needs faster and in a more convenient manner.

### Recommendation
The team addresses the business’ problem by creating a system or an online store which will help the business improve. In a matter of time and client decision, the system may be upgraded, and more features could be added apart from the general features that are needed for the first deployment of the system.

### Justification
Applying the system created for Villamin Wood and Iron Works will increase the possibility of expanding their customer reach and increase product sales in comparison to their initial use of Facebook Page. This ordering system will help customers order their desired products even when they are at home or at their workplace. It will provide easy communication between the customer and the client, and an easy transaction for the products or items, this will help Villamin Wood and Iron Works gain more customers and increase their sales continuously without errors or problems. However, this system will not replace their initial page in Facebook, but rather it will help the system to be more advertised and seen by other potential customers.

## Alternatives Analysis
There are other alternatives that the team has put into consideration for the Business's concern. Listed are those alternative solutions alongside with why the team did not lean towards it: <br>
1. Focus on the current business process.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Though the company and its employees have grown accustomed to their current practice, this method could impose a threat compared to their competitors. As other competitors innovate their way through online platforms, they also increase their chances of attracting customers, and have a well-documented process. If the company were to disregard innovation in marketing, they might find it more difficult to market what they are selling and rely only on what was written. </p>
2. Enhance the company's Facebook page.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> The client already has a Facebook page, but this limits them from customizing their page in a way that may help them introduce their company to the mass public. </p>
3. Sell products through available ecommerce websites.

# Project Charter Plan
## Executive Summary
Since 1983, our company, Villamin Wood & Iron Works, has proven the durability of the products. But they lack customer reach and sales. Due to that problem, Villamin Wood & Iron Works System has been created to help reach out to more customers, not only through on-shop, but also through online, which will also help increase the company’s sales. The project is being created as a solution and in line with the current ordering system to accomplish both the customer and company’s needs.

## Project Purpose/Justification
### Business Need/Case
The Villamin Wood & Iron Works System has been created to help the company increase their sales and customer reach to take back the loss in income from the sudden temporary closing of shop due to the pandemic. Also, to enhance the conveniency of their customers. In this approach, it will eliminate unnecessary expenses of the company. The cost to make the system successful will be covered by the company owner, recovered by the system's anticipated results.
Business Objectives 
### Business Objectives 
1. Strengthen customer service.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> Develop goals that motivate them and ensure that our customers and clients have a positive experience with our services. And emphasize the importance of providing an exceptional customer experience every time we connect with our customers and clients. </p>
2. Sell a more reliable product.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> Our company will set quality and troubleshooting goals to identify areas for improvement within our products. With this, we will be able to give constant enhancements and upgrades based on the demands of our clients. </p>

## Project Description
The Villamin Wood & Iron Works System will support the increase in the company’s sales and customer reach. The system will provide easy navigation and transaction to avoid complications while the system is being used by customers. The system will be an additional tool from the company’s current platform to attain their objectives while allowing customers to browse and process orders easily.

### Project Objectives and Success Criteria
#### Constraints
These are the following constraints pertain to Villamin Wood and Iron works: <br>
1. It is necessary to purchase if there are any additional requirements within the allocated budget and time limit. <br>
2. The stakeholder will provide the necessary information for the project. <br>
3. The software to be used must be suitable for our IT (Information Technology) platforms.
#### Assumptions
1. There will be communication between the team and the company if there are complications occur upon deployment. <br>
2. If there are more resources, the company and the team will discuss.

## Preliminary Scope Statement
This project created by the MLNSD team will include designing, improving, testing and delivery of an improved online ordering system for the client, Villamin Wood & Iron Works. The improved system will require internet use to capture the orders and training of the client's staff to manage and administer the website. The project will conclude once the system is ready for deployment.

## Risks
The following risks are what the team has foreseen that could affect the performance output of the project proposed: <br>
1. Denial of service <br> <br>
&nbsp; a. Web Services that are not accessible to the users, render potential loss of profit. <br>
&nbsp; b. A factor that causes Denial of Service is web traffic entering the system. When the system has received user requests beyond its capacity, it may lead to a system crash. <br>
&nbsp; c. Malicious attacks also play a role. In which hackers flood/overflow the request, impair the servers, and cause inoperability. <br>
&nbsp; d. Not only will customers suffer from the system's malfunction caused by external factors, but the company's workforce will not be able to complete the tasks required to fulfill the needed output. <br> <br> 
2. SQL injections <br> <br>
&nbsp; a. Hackers use this technique to alter the desired algorithm (within the source code) by the developers. This in return gives more control to them. It also increases the company's system vulnerabilities. <br> <br>
3. Data breach <br> <br>
&nbsp; a. Data breach is a process of hackers collecting data without any form of authorization from the product owners. The data can be used to damage the company and its stakeholder's reputation for the benefit of the infiltrator. <br>
&nbsp; b. Despite having numerous methods of attacks (such as, insider leak, loss or theft of information, and unintended disclosure), the prior risks may also be a factor that may contribute to this. <br> <br>
4. Cybersquatting <br> <br>
&nbsp; a. Cybersquatting is a way for external affairs to take advantage of the websites' domain. <br>
&nbsp; b. Cybersquatters manipulate the reputation and domain of the company and use it to redirect users to a different service and/or platform.

<p> With the listed risks, the team will collaborate with the stakeholders and ensure that the foreseen risks will be tended to. In preparation to reinforce the project based on the risks listed, the team will create solutions that are aligned with the project budget and constraints. If the risks were to affect the system, the team will ensure this is handled with immediate response. </p>

## Project Deliverables
Following the project's successful conclusion, the following deliverables must be met. These deliverables cannot be altered without the project sponsor's consent. <br>
1. Product <br>
2. Logo <br>
