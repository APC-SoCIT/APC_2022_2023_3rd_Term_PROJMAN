## 3. Company Profile
**Brief Background:**
Ms. Devilyn C. Ligligen is the owner of a small-scale retail outlet situated on Mt. Makiling St., Post Proper Southside, Makati City. She caters to sari-sari stores and a diverse range of customers in the surrounding vicinity, providing goods for both wholesale and retail transactions.

***
## 4. Business Case
### 4.1 Executive Summary
Bregghan Mini Grocery Store is a family-owned business that supplies retail, wholesale, and bulk products to residents and sari-sari stores in the area. The store's current system for tracking sales and stocks is manual, using pen and paper, which has led to difficulty in monitoring inventory and potential loss of sales due to items being out of stock. To address these pain points, our team aims to develop a responsive webapp that digitizes the recording of stocks and sales, notifies the user when stocks are at a critical level, and automates the computation of sold items. The webapp will also produce a report that shows daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly records sold.

***
### 4.2 Issue
**Manual inventory tracking:**
The current system at Bregghan mini grocery store involves manual recording of stocks and sales on paper, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The lack of a proper inventory management system can result in out-of-stock items and missed sales opportunities. 

**Inefficient sales tracking:**
The current sales tracking process relies on hand-written receipts, which can lead to errors in the computation of sold items and total sales. This can result in inaccurate sales data and hinder the store's ability to make informed business decisions.

**Lack of real-time monitoring:**
Without a digital system, the staff at Bregghan mini grocery store are unable to monitor stocks and sales in real-time. This can result in missed opportunities to replenish stock levels and can make it difficult for the store to keep up with customer demand.

***
### 4.3 Anticipated Outcomes
**Improved inventory management:**
The implementation of a digitized sales and stock tracking system will allow Bregghan mini grocery store to have accurate and real-time data on their inventory. This will enable them to make informed decisions on when to replenish stock, which products to order, and how much stock to order, leading to a reduction in stock outs and overstocking.

**Increased sales:**
With the implementation of a Point-of-Sale (POS) system, the checkout process will be faster and more efficient. Customers will have a better experience and may be more likely to return. The system will also be able to generate reports on the top-selling products, which can help the store to make informed decisions on product placement and marketing strategies.

**Reduced errors:**
The automated computation of items sold will significantly reduce the occurrence of human errors, which can lead to miscounting of inventory and discrepancies in sales records. This will result in more accurate sales and inventory data.

**Enhanced customer experience:**
The system will provide a better copy of receipts, allowing customers to keep track of their purchases. This can help in building customer trust and loyalty.

**Increased productivity:**
The implementation of a digitized sales and stock tracking system will reduce the workload of the staff, as they will no longer have to manually record sales and inventory. This will free up their time, allowing them to focus on other tasks that can improve the store's operations.

***
### 4.4 Recommendation
To address the identified business problem of inefficient stock and sales monitoring at Bregghan mini grocery store, we recommend developing a responsive web application that digitizes the recording of stocks and sales, automates computation of sold items, and produces reports for daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly records. By implementing this solution, the staff and manager of Bregghan mini grocery store will be able to monitor stocks and sales in real-time, reducing workload and minimizing human error. This will lead to more efficient inventory management and faster checkouts, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and retention. The system will also provide alerts when stock levels reach a critical point, allowing the store to replenish inventory on time and avoid potential revenue loss due to out-of-stock items. Furthermore, the application's capability to produce detailed sales reports will provide useful insights to the business, allowing for data-driven decision-making to further optimize operations and profitability. Overall, we believe that the proposed solution will address the identified business problem and provide significant benefits to Bregghan mini grocery store, its staff, and its customers.

***
### 4.5 Justification
The implementation of the proposed project is justified by the following reasons:

**Improved Efficiency:**
The current manual system used by Bregghan mini grocery store for tracking sales and inventory is time-consuming and prone to errors. By implementing a digitized system, the staff and manager can track sales and inventory in real-time, reducing the workload, and improving overall efficiency.

**Better Inventory Management:**
The proposed project will allow for more accurate tracking of inventory levels and ensure that items are restocked on time, avoiding stock outs that can lead to lost sales.

**Increased Sales:**
With better inventory management and automated tracking of sales, the store can ensure that popular items are always in stock, leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction.

**Improved Customer Experience:** 
The implementation of a POS-like system will enable the store to provide better customer service, including faster checkouts and more accurate receipts.

### 4.7 Problem Statement
Bregghan mini grocery store is currently facing several issues in their daily operations, which are mainly caused by their manual recording and tracking system. Specifically, the store experiences difficulty in monitoring their inventory, which can result in insufficient stocks or overstocking. Additionally, the manual computation of sold items often leads to errors, which affects the accuracy of their sales records. As a result, the store loses potential customers due to a lack of available items, leading to decreased profits. Furthermore, the current process of tracking sales and stocks is time consuming, which can lead to slower checkouts and longer queues. Overall, the business problem is the need for a more efficient and accurate system to monitor inventory and sales to improve the overall customer experience and increase revenue.

***
### 4.8 Organizational Impact
The implementation of the proposed project will have a significant impact on the organizational processes, tools, hardware, and software of Bregghan mini grocery store. It will require the adoption of new technology and the implementation of new processes to manage sales and inventory in a digitized and automated way. The system will replace the traditional pen-and-paper method of tracking sales and inventory, which will require staff to be trained in the use of the new technology.

New roles will be created to manage the system and ensure its proper functioning. The manager will have access to the system's reporting tools to generate daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly reports on sales and inventory. The system will also require the creation of a database of products that the store offers, and this will need to be updated and maintained regularly.

The proposed project will bring a positive impact to the organizational processes, increasing the efficiency and accuracy of sales and inventory tracking. The store staff will be able to manage the stock level in real-time, making restocking more efficient and reducing the risk of stockouts. The system will also provide better insight into product performance and inventory management, allowing for better decision-making and more informed business strategies.

***
### 4.9 Technology Migration
The plan for the Bregghan POS System involves the creation of a website and mobile application that will be powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the database. AWS is a type of cloud service that allows businesses to rent computing resources like servers, storage, and databases. The developers chose AWS for the mini grocery store due to its scalability, allowing the store to scale up or down easily to meet changing demands in the future without worrying about managing their infrastructure. AWS is also highly reliable and can handle large volumes of traffic and data without slowing down. The data migration process will ensure that all necessary data is transferred to the new system, and the new system will undergo thorough testing to ensure reliability, efficiency, and security.
