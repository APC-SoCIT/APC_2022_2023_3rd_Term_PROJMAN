<h1>Work Breakdown Structure</h1>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p align=" justify">
Work breakdown structure is a tool in project management to divide larges projects to get things done faster and efficiently. The WBS structure gives a clear knowledge of the project scope, deliverables, and activities at each level, representing an increasingly precise description of the project work. The work breakdown structure (WBS) acts as a roadmap for project managers to plan, execute, and monitor project activities, and it helps to guarantee that all project requirements are satisfied within the time and budget constraints.

The Work Breakdown Structure presented here represents all the work required to complete this project.</p>
