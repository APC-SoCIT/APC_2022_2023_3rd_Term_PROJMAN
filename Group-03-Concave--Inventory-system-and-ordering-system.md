<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p align=" justify">
The Inventory system and Ordering system is a web-app and a mob-app base for Torrecamps Company. Initially, they had their attention to "pandemic essentials" such facemasks, alcohol, tissues, and gloves. The application will serve as their main medium for processing the customer’s order.

The mobile application for the customer will be limited only to android OS. For customers that walk-in, the admin will process their order using the ordering system that the group develops. Their mode of payment will be limited also to cash on delivery or COD in short.

Currently the client is doing their transactions manually, getting the orders manually, relying on Microsoft excel for its inventory, and no database of their customer and supplier makes it to have a human error of 30% out of 100% when they produce handwritten receipts.

Integrating their current transaction process into the digitalized set up by developing the system for inventory and ordering system that would make it more efficient and transparent way for the customer’s end.
 </p>
<h4>1.1 Issue</h4>

This will make the company run smoother because this will free up manpower for them to allocate to more important tasks.</p>
<h4>1.3 Recommendation</h4>
<p align=" justify">
To address these challenges, Torrecamps should invest in an Inventory System and Ordering System that can automate inventory management and ordering processes, streamline workflows, and reduce errors. The new system should be scalable, user-friendly, and provide real-time inventory information to customers.</p>
<h4>1.4 Justification</h4>
<p align=" justify">
An Inventory System and Ordering System for Torrecamps Company is necessary to automate inventory management, streamline workflows, enhance customer satisfaction, reduce costs, and improve scalability. The new system will provide Torrecamps with a competitive edge, enabling the company to grow its business and enhance its brand reputation in the long run.</p>

<h1>Problem Definition</h1>
<h4>3.1 Problem Statement</h4>
<p align=" justify">
Since 2017, Torrecamps Marketing has been in business and has been selling essentials. They began selling "Pandemic Essentials" including alcohol and tissues during the pandemic. As a result, they gained more customers and stock, began working with other businesses, and expanded their selection of products. Their system remained static while their inventory and client base grew, making it challenging for them to keep up with the increase in orders that needed to be handled.</p>
<h4>3.2 Organizational Impact</h4>
<p align=" justify">
Having this project developed by the group can have a lot of impact if it's approved. The first one is Torrecamps Marketing. The impact this system will have on Torrecamps Marketing will be that the clients can serve customers more quickly and effectively when it comes to producing printable and digital receipts for every transaction. Next is the impact of this system on the customers. In the customers’ side, the proposed system will now produce printed receipts. This is crucial since printed receipts cannot be changed. </p>
<h4>3.3 Technology Migration</h4>
<p align=" justify">
Torrecamps Marketing currently uses desktop computers, laptops and printers for their main hardware. They also use Facebook messenger, Microsoft Excel and a 25 MBPS Converge internet provider as their main network. These tools provide a lot of things going for the client. Like facebook they post pictures with prices to advertise them. Next is customers can order their desired items using facebook messenger. And lastly there will be Microsoft Excel. Excel provides the client with a lot of things like listing customer information and listing orders. Next is printing receipts and fixing orders. Lastly there is the inventory and total sales per day. 

Now that the group is tasked to create a system that helps the clients. The proposed solution of the team that will be implemented is an inventory and an ordering system. The website will be able to present the items that the client is selling. Then every order of the customer will be recorded into the inventory and the ordering system.  The team will use Bootstrap studio, Visual Studio Code and XAMPP to develop the project. The website will intergrate CAMSS. The system will have a cloud-based database server. Next is tye project will have an inventory and ordering system where they can create, edit, or delete all items and information that are needed to change on the website. 3rd will be that the team plans to integrate the system in both desktop and mobile devices. The Facebook part will not be removed since it is used for their advertisement. Lastly the team will continue monitoring the website and install anti-malware software on the computer to ensure their security.

<h1>Strategic Alignment</h1>
<p align=" justify">
Torrecamps Marketing is currently looking to grow their business in terms of their inventory to keep up with their already growing customer base. The system that they currently have in place has multiple flaws that leads to them needing time to compensate and cover for their mistakes, this is where the group’s project comes in as it automates their transactional tasks and inventory tasks giving them more time and manpower to focus on other tasks that they need to be focusing on in order to improve their company.</p>
<h1>Cost Benefit Analysis</h1>
<p align=" justify">
The only expense in the project would be the price for the URL which is usually around Php 2-5k. With this expense a system that could automate the inventory and ordering processes will be given to the client. The system would free up the staff so that they can focus on other aspects of their business, and this will then lead to better sales for the company. While currently they are not paying the 2-5k mentioned before they are losing on possible sales and business by allotting their time to fixing the problems that their current system brings them. </p>
<h1>Alternative Analysis</h1>
<p align=" justify">
After the group communicated with the client, they found out that the client was planning on doing nothing to solve their current problems and that the only reason they wanted an upgrade was because the group went up to them. If they would have chosen not to do anything their current problems would be plaguing them deep into their future as a company.</p>
<h1>Approvals</h1>
<p align=" justify">
The completion of the Inventory System and Ordering System project for Torrecamps Company will be authorized solely by the project client, Torrecamps Company. The project will only be considered complete when Torrecamps Company approves the system's functionality and determines that it meets the project goals and objectives. Any changes or modifications to the project scope or timeline must also be approved by Torrecamps Company.</p>

<h1>Work Breakdown Structure</h1>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p align=" justify">
Work breakdown structure is a tool in project management to divide larges projects to get things done faster and efficiently. The WBS structure gives a clear knowledge of the project scope, deliverables, and activities at each level, representing an increasingly precise description of the project work. The work breakdown structure (WBS) acts as a roadmap for project managers to plan, execute, and monitor project activities, and it helps to guarantee that all project requirements are satisfied within the time and budget constraints.

The Work Breakdown Structure presented here represents all the work required to complete this project.</p>

<h1>Scope Management Plan</h1>
<h4>Introduction </h4>
1. Collect Requirements – The project team will use a number of methods to collect, and the system's requirements should be documented via user interviews with the client, adviser and consultant meetings and subject professor meetings.  
2. User Stories – The project team will create user stories to describe the functionality of the system from the perspective of the end user. These stories will be prioritized based on business value and will be used to guide the development process. 
3. Scope Statement – The scope statement will be developed using the user stories created and requirements as input. It will provide a high-level overview of the project scope, including the deliverables, and constraints. 
4. Scope Baseline - The user stories and scope statement will be added to a project management plan to create the scope baseline. It will be frequently updated as the project develops to allow for scope changes. 

<h4>Scope Documentation</h4>
The scope of I.O System will be documented by the methods listed here: 

1.<strong>Requirements documentation:</strong> The system requirements will be documented that outlines the system’s functional and non-functional requirements. 
2.<strong>Project management plan:</strong> This will include information about the scope of the project, also includes scope statement and the scope baseline. Other relevant information about the scope of the project is also part of this project management plan.  <br>
3.<strong>Change log:</strong> This will be added and maintained to track all changes to the scope of the project, this includes the description of the change, project impact and required approvals.  

<h4>Scope Control</h4> 
The scope of this project is controlled throughout these following activities: 

1.<strong>Scope Verification:</strong> The agile testing techniques will be the project team’s desired method to verify that the deliverables of the project will meet the requirements and align with the scope statement.  
2.<strong>Scope change control:</strong> Any changes to the scope of the project will be directed through a formal change control process, which will include an assessment of the impact on the project schedule, budget, and quality. <br>
3.<strong>Scope change review:</strong>  This will be held for each change request to ensure that the change is necessary, feasible, and aligned with the project objectives.
