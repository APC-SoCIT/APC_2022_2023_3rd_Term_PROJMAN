1.  **Company Profile**

2.  **Business Case**

    1.  **Problem Definition**

        1.  **Problem Statement**

> Madonna's Resort and Events Center is a resort and events center which
> provides booking and reservation in their facilities, swimming in
> public or private pool, and having an event hall for company outing
> activities or organization activities. The resort is newly opened in
> Malvar, Batangas. They started creating the resort during the start of
> pandemic, way back 2020. Currently, they are using Google forms to be
> manually encoded by their staff and spreadsheets that they sometimes
> use whenever the form is inaccessible which sometimes causes conflicts
> in the reservation of facilities and date. 
>
> There is a difference between the reservation and booking. The
> reservation is for the entrance fee of the individual on the resort
> who wants to use the pool and event center, while bookings are for the
> cottages and rooms of the customer.  

2.  **Organizational Impact**

The implementation of the system will help improve the overall
performance the Madonna's resort staff since it will prevent more human
errors and have their work more efficient when they are encoding the
data of their customer during reservations and bookings. 

3.  **Technology Migration**

The system will be developed by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the
frontend development; For the backend development, Django with built-in
SQL, and Python, are used. This programming language and framework are
what the website is composed of. In terms of data migration, since
Django has a built-in database, it will be easy to export the data as
there is an added feature for the staff of Madonna's. 

2.  **Project Overview**

2.2.1 Project Description 

To address the issue of unnecessary dispatch and truck rolls, the
project aims to develop a system which is a website that will help
Madonna's Resort on reservations, as well as blog and photo gallery. As
an overview of these tools, reservations are done through filling out a
form on the website and will redirect to a page that will produce a
receipt which will then the customer can used to make a down payment on
Gcash since it is included in the receipt. This will then be transferred
to the database that which admin and staff of the resort whose logged on
the website can check, confirm, edit, and remove the receipt depending
on the circumstances. Logging in on the website is only exclusive for
the admin and staff of the resort and there is no redirection for the
login page on the home page; It is provided only via a link. Blog is
where the admin and staff post details and advertisements for the
resort. They can add, edit, and delete posts on the blog and have
complete control with no limitations to what they can publish. Only the
admin and staff of the resort can publish a post. The photo gallery is
where the resort can post their latest pictures and are categorized so
that ease of sorting can help both the resort and customer see what they
need to look at. It is configured through their account on the website
that they can add and edit, which is similar to blog but is purposed for
photo gallery. 

 

Doing this project will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
Madonna's Resort by providing them a website that combines all they
needed that helps them track their changes better and publish what they
want as they have control with no limitations on the website. 

2.  Goals and Objectives 

The project aims to improve the reservation and advertisement of the
resort by providing an interactive and responsive website that can
provide a reservation management system. 

 

For the team to achieve these, their specific objectives are: 

1.  Keep track of reservations and booking data of customers in
    > real-time using a single medium. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  Reduce cases of conflicts in schedules to 0. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  Reduce cases of unauthorized writing on the booking records by 70%. 

```{=html}

2.  Project Performance 

To measure the performance of the proposed project about developing a
website for the Madonna's Resort and Events Center, the following
measures can be considered: 

 

-   Data accuracy: Measured the accuracy of sales report by using the
    > sales report feature included in the system. 

-   Cost Savings: Measured by comparing the cost of maintaining the
    > system versus the subscription on different platforms like
    > Facebook and Google. 

-   Process Improvement: This can be measured by comparing the
    > efficiency and effectiveness of the system versus the multiple
    > platforms they used.

3.  **Cost and Benefit Analysis**

The cost-benefit analysis will help determine the potential benefit of
Madonna's Web system in comparison to the cost incurred. The primary
benefit of this project is the improvement of efficiency and accuracy in
booking and reservations, computation of sales, and advertising. The
system will allow for faster response times, leading to improved
customer satisfaction and reduced operational costs. 

1.  Benefits: 

> Below are the identified benefits that the project can bring once
> fully implemented: 

-   Improved admin and staff online interaction as they have control and
    > no limitations to what they can do since the system has provided
    > and resolved the need and lacking features than the multiple
    > platforms they used. 

-   Improved customer booking and reservations, as the system has this
    > feature that is improved solely for business. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Improved efficiency and effectiveness of Madonna's resort resulting
    > in better productivity and less human errors. 

-   Improved visibility into the work of the resort staff, enabling
    > managers and owners to monitor the progress of the system and
    > identify potential issues like human errors. 

2.  Costs: 

-   Development and implementation cost zero as it is a project-based
    > learning and the framework used in developing the system is free. 

-   Maintenance cost less as the client only needed to provide the
    > system a subscription fee for the chosen online cloud web hosting
    > site for the project to be deployed online. 

    1.  Alternatives Analysis 

An alternative analysis for the Madonna's Web project could include the
following options: 

**Option 1: Do nothing (status quo)** 

In this option, the business would continue to use the platform and
tools to maintain reservation and advertisement. 

**Pros:** No upfront and disruption to existing platforms and tool. 

**Cons:** Potential for ongoing costs and difficulties on the platform
and tools they used which would lead to conflict of reservation,
difficulty in reserving and advertising, and computation of sales. 

 

**Option 2: Creating a website through hiring of developers** 

In this option, the business will create the website that will resolve
the difficulties and limitations they had on the existing platform they
are using. 

**Pros:** Improved efficiency and effectives, have more direct control
and create into their liking. 

**Cons:** Possible increase cost due to the business needing to hire a
team of professionals to create their website 

 

**Option 3: Use of website builders** 

Multiple reasons for not selecting this option are that it is free but
have limitations; It has multiple subscription tiers, and the
maintenance cost is higher than creating or hiring developers; Lack of
features even when subscribed which can be a disadvantage to the
business if the feature, they want is lacking on the website builder. 

2.  Approvals 

The project approval should come from the project sponsor -- Micheal
James Gnilo, the owner of Madonna's Resort and Events Center.

**[Introduction]{.smallcaps} **

The goal of the project is to make Madonna\'s Resort\'s online
interactions better by developing a website that will assist in solving
their issues. The reservation system and other website elements that
will be promoted online will be covered by the study. The customer can
easily reserve a cottage and other amenities for the day of their
reservation with the aid of the online booking system. By including a
monthly sales report for the resort and digitizing it so that management
can quickly examine their profit and track the days and weekly sales of
Madonna\'s Resort, the developers will also add analytics to the
project. Interviews with the client and their comments will help used by
the developers to create an interactive and user-friendly website that
can be beneficial to the customer and the business.

identify and create the Work needed for the project and break it down as
needed. 

 

**Verify Scope-** The business will be able to maximize the value of the
project and ensure that it is contributing to the success of the
business by coordinating the Madonna\'s Web project with the overall
strategic goals and objectives of Madonna\'s Resort and Events Center.
The project aligns with this goal by enhancing through resolving the
limitations they had when using their existing multiple websites. 

 

**Control Scope-** Better admin and staff online engagement because the
system has supplied and addressed the need and missing capabilities
compared to the many platforms they utilized, giving them control and
removing restrictions on what they can do. better reservations and
bookings for customers, as the system contains a function that has been
improved specifically for the company. Better productivity and fewer
human errors are the results of Madonna\'s resort\'s increased
efficiency and effectiveness. Enhanced insight into resort employees\'
work allows managers and owners to keep track of system progress and
spot potential problems like human errors.

**[Scope Definition]{.smallcaps} **

 

 

**[Project Scope Statement]{.smallcaps} **

 

**Product Scope Description** -- Madonna\'s Web will accomplish
developing a website that integrates reservation system and other
website elements that will be promoted online. Where the customer can
easily reserve a cottage and other amenities for the day of their
reservation with the aid of the online booking system. By including a
monthly sales report for the resort and digitizing it so that management
can quickly examine their profit and track the days and weekly sales of
Madonna\'s Resort, the developers will also add analytics to the project
to sort documents. 

 

**Product Acceptance Criteria** - The researchers created a functioning
system that incorporates a reservation system and enables customers to
quickly book a cottage or other amenities online. will be used by the
programmers to build an interactive and user-friendly website that will
be advantageous to both the client and the company. 

 

**Project Deliverables-** The integrated website that will help the
Madonna's reservation which will make it easier to record and make a
statement of schedule of the user. Then it will record the customer
information to make an appointment. So, after Madonna's Website is done
the code will be processed which helps define the system and understand
how it works and the researchers will pass it to the client once it is
done. 

 

**Project Exclusions** 

 

-   Interactive Map -- Similar to google maps but focuses on interacting
    > only in the vicinity of Madonna's Resort. It works by going
    > through the interactive map page on the website and from there
    > users can click the buildings which display the information or
    > with the prices if they click the cottages. Due to time
    > constraints, it has not been included in the project and it is
    > outside of scope as the main objective is to have an online
    > reservation system for the Madonna' Resort. 

 

**Project Constraints-** The Madonna Web system\'s possible benefits in
relation to costs will be determined with the aid of the cost-benefit
analysis. This project\'s main advantage is the increase in efficiency
and precision in reservations, sales calculations, and advertising. The
system\'s quicker reaction times will increase customer satisfaction and
lower operating expenses. Because it is project-based learning and the
framework used to develop the system is free, development and
implementation have not cost. Because the client only had to pay a
subscription fee to the system\'s preferred online cloud hosting
provider in order for the project to go live online, maintenance costs
were lower. 

 

 

**Project Assumptions-** The project\'s goal is to create a system,
which includes a website with a blog and a photo gallery, to assist
Madonna\'s Resort with reservations. To give an overview of these tools,
reservations are made by filling out a form on the website, which
directs to a page that generates a receipt that the consumer may use to
pay a deposit using Gcash because it is contained in the receipt. Then,
depending on the situation, this will be transferred to the database
where the resort\'s admin and staff who are logged in can check,
confirm, edit, and remove the receipt.

**[Scope Verification]{.smallcaps} **

 

The project team will use various techniques for scope verification to
guarantee that the Dispatch Directory System project deliverables
satisfy the original scope. These methods include: 

  

-   **Quality Checklists** 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   These lists will outline the specific requirements that each
    > deliverable is met to be accepted. The project team will use these
    > checklists to verify that each deliverable meets all necessary
    > criteria before moving forward. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Work Performance Measurements** 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The project team will track and measure the progress of each
    > deliverable as it is being developed. This will allow the team to
    > identify potential issues or deviations from the original scope
    > and address them in a timely manner. 

 

-   **Scope Baseline** 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The project team will create and maintain a scope baseline, which is
    > a snapshot of the original project scope. Any changes to the scope
    > must be documented and approved before they are implemented. The
    > scope baseline will be used to ensure that the final deliverables
    > meet the original scope. 

 

-   **Formal Acceptance** 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The project sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders will formally
    > accept each deliverable as it is completed. To ensure that the
    > project team is meeting the expectations of all relevant parties
    > -- allowing any necessary feedback or changes to be made in a
    > timely manner. 

 

**[Scope Control]{.smallcaps} **

 

The scope control process for the project will involve regular reviews
of the project's progress to ensure that they align with the original
project scope as defined in the Project Scope statement. The Project
Manager will be responsible for monitoring and controlling the project's
scope, with assistance from the project team and stakeholders. Periodic
reviews of the project's scope will be conducted to ensure that the
project remains on track and within the defined boundaries. 

 

The scope control process for the Madonna's Web project will involve the
following steps for making the changes to the scope baseline: 

 

1.  A scope change request will be initiated by the stakeholder or team
    > member who identifies a need for change to the scope. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  The scope change request will be reviewed by the Project Manager and
    > Project Sponsor to assess the impact on the project schedule,
    > budget, and resources. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  If the change is deemed low impact, the Project Manager and Project
    > Sponsor can approve or deny the request. If the change is deemed
    > high impact, the Project Manager and Project Sponsor can approve
    > or deny the request. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
4.  If the request is approved, the Project Manager will create an
    > action plan to proceed with the change and update the scope
    > baseline and notify all relevant stakeholders of the change. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
5.  If the request is rejected, the project team will continue with the
    > project scope. 

    4.  **Cost Management Plan**

    5.  **Schedule Management Plan**

**[Introduction]{.smallcaps} **

The project schedule is the roadmap for how the project will be
executed.  Schedules are an important part of any project as they
provide the project team, sponsor, and stakeholders with a picture of
the project's status at any given time.  The purpose of the schedule
management plan is to define the approach the project team will use in
creating the project schedule.  This plan also includes how the team
will monitor the project schedule and manage changes after the baseline
schedule has been approved. This includes identifying, analyzing,
documenting, prioritizing, approving, or rejecting, and publishing all
schedule-related changes.   

 

**[Schedule Management Approach]{.smallcaps} **

Project schedules will be created using Microsoft Project starting with
the deliverables identified in the project's Work Breakdown Structure
(WBS).  Activity definition will identify the specific work packages
which must be performed to complete each deliverable.  Activity
sequencing will be used to determine the order of work packages and
assign relationships between project activities.  Activity duration
estimating will be used to calculate the number of work periods required
to complete work packages.  Resource estimating will be used to assign
resources to work packages to complete schedule development. 

 

Once a preliminary schedule has been developed, it will be reviewed by
the project team and any resources tentatively assigned to project
tasks.  The project team and resources must agree to the proposed work
package assignments, durations, and schedule.  Once this is achieved the
project sponsor will review and approve the schedule and it will then be
baselined. 

 

The following will be designated as milestones for the project
schedule: 

-   Completion of scope statement and WBS/WBS Dictionary

Roles and responsibilities for schedule development are as follows: 

 

The project manager will be responsible for facilitating work package
definition, sequencing, and estimating duration and resources with the
project team. The project manager will also create the project schedule
using Microsoft Project and validate the schedule with the project team,
stakeholders, and the project sponsor.  The project manager will obtain
schedule approval from the project sponsor and baseline the schedule. 

 

The project team is responsible for participating in work package
definition, sequencing, and duration and resource estimating.  The
project team will also review and validate the proposed schedule and
perform assigned activities once the schedule is approved. 

 

The project sponsor will participate in reviews of the proposed schedule
and approve the final schedule before it is baselined. 

 

The project stakeholders will participate in reviews of the proposed
schedule and assist in its validation. 

 

**[Schedule Control]{.smallcaps} **

The project schedule will be reviewed and updated as necessary on a
bi-weekly basis with actual start, actual finish, and completion
percentages which will be provided by task owners.   

 

The project manager is responsible for holding bi-weekly schedule
updates/reviews; determining impacts of schedule variances; submitting
schedule change requests; and reporting schedule status in accordance
with the project's communications plan. 

 

The project team is responsible for participating in bi-weekly schedule
updates/reviews; communicating any changes to actual start/finish dates
to the project manager; and participating in schedule variance
resolution activities as needed. 

 

The project sponsor will maintain awareness of the project schedule
status and review/approve any schedule change requests submitted by the
project manager. 

 

** **

**[Schedule Changes and Thresholds]{.smallcaps} **

If any member of the project team determines that a change to the
schedule is necessary, the project manager and team will meet to review
and evaluate the change.  The project manager and project team must
determine which tasks will be impacted, variance because of the
potential change, and any alternatives or variance resolution activities
they may employ to see how they would affect the scope, schedule, and
resources.  If, after this evaluation is complete, the project manager
determines that any change will exceed the established boundary
conditions, then a schedule change request must be submitted. 

 

Submittal of a schedule change request to the project sponsor for
approval is required if either of the two following conditions is true: 

-   The proposed change is estimated to reduce the duration of an
    > individual work package by 10% or more or increase the duration of
    > an individual work package by 10% or more. 

-   The change is estimated to reduce the duration of the overall
    > baseline schedule by 10% or more or increase the duration of the
    > overall baseline schedule by 10% or more. 

Any change requests that do not meet these thresholds may be submitted
to the project manager for approval. 

 

Once the change request has been reviewed and approved the project
manager is responsible for adjusting the schedule and communicating all
changes and impacts to the project team, project sponsor, and
stakeholders.  The project manager must also ensure that all change
requests are archived in the project records repository. 

 

**[Scope Change]{.smallcaps} **

Any changes in the project scope, which have been approved by the
project sponsor, will require the project team to evaluate the effect of
the scope change on the current schedule.  If the project manager
determines that the scope change will significantly affect the current
project schedule, he/she may request that the schedule be re-baselined
in consideration of any changes which need to be made as part of the new
project scope.  The project sponsor must review and approve this request
before the schedule can be re-baselined. 

 

4.  **Staffing Management Plan**

```{=html}

```
1.  Introduction 

> A strong human resource management strategy is critical to the success
> of any project. It acts as a template for how the project team will be
> managed and structured, and it assists in ensuring that the
> appropriate people with the right qualifications are in the right
> place at the right time. Roles and duties, communication protocols,
> and performance management measures are all part of the strategy. 

 

> Using this plan, the project manager and project team can effectively
> manage the project by ensuring that all team members understand their
> roles and responsibilities, that communication is open and effective,
> and that performance is monitored and managed in a way that
> contributes to the project\'s overall success. 

 

2.  Roles and Responsibilities 

 

> An effective human resources management plan is crucial for the
> successful completion of any project. It outlines the roles and
> responsibilities of all project team members and stakeholders,
> ensuring that everyone is aware of their individual contributions and
> how they fit into the bigger picture. 
>
> The plan also defines the level of authority and decision-making power
> held by each team member, ensuring that resources are allocated and
> utilized effectively. By clearly defining competencies and skill
> requirements, the plan ensures that the right people are in the right
> roles to achieve project success. 

 

> Overall, the human resources management plan acts as a roadmap for the
> project team, guiding them towards successful project execution and
> delivery.

4.  Staffing Management 

 

> The Staffing Management Plan for the Resort Management System is a
> critical component in ensuring the successful execution of the
> project. It outlines the strategies and processes for acquiring,
> managing, and releasing human resources throughout the project
> lifecycle. 

 

-   Acquisition of human resources will be done during the first stage
    > of the development, where the Project Lead will be given the task
    > of fielding their team and finding their clients. 

-   Training for any resources with identified gaps in skills required
    > will be provided to them by their respective professors. Any
    > lapses can be addressed by their selected project advisers. 

-   Performance reviews will be conducted at every end of the phase to
    > assess the performance of team members and identify areas for
    > improvement. These reviews will also provide feedback on how well
    > team members are meeting the project\'s expectations and
    > objectives. 

 

> It is important to note that depending on the scope of the project,
> there may be other items included in staffing management such as
> government and/or regulatory compliance, organizational health, and
> safety, etc. It depends on the specific requirements and regulations
> of the industry and the location in which the Resort Reservation
> System project is being implemented. Government and regulatory
> compliance may be a consideration if the project is subject to
> specific laws and regulations related to data privacy and security.  

 

> The Staffing Management Plan will be regularly reviewed and updated as
> necessary to ensure that it remains aligned with the project\'s
> objectives and requirements. It is important for the project manager
> to conduct a thorough analysis of the project\'s specific requirements
> and regulations to determine if any additional items need to be
> included in the staffing management plan.

4.  **Change Management Plan**

> **INTRODUCTION** 

 

> The Change Management Plan was created for the Madonna's Web Project
> in order to set expectations on how the approach to changes will be
> managed, what defines a change, the purpose and role of the change
> control board, and the overall change management process. All
> stakeholders will be expected to submit or request changes to
> Madonna's Web in accordance with this Change Management Plan and all
> requests and submissions will follow the process detailed herein. 

 

> **CHANGE MANAGEMENT APPROACH** 

 

> The Change Management approach for Madonna's Web will ensure that all
> proposed changes are defined, reviewed, and agreed upon so they can be
> properly implemented and communicated to  all stakeholders. This
> approach will also ensure that only changes within the scope of this
> project are approved and implemented. 

 

> The Change Management approach is not to be confused with the Change
> Management Process which will be detailed later in this plan. The
> Change Management approach consists of three areas: 

-   Ensure changes are within scope and beneficial to the project. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Ensure changes do not exceed the limitations of the project. 

-   Determine how the change will be implemented. 

-   Manage the change as it is implemented. 

 

> The Change Management process has been designed to make sure this
> approach is followed for all changes. By using this approach
> methodology, the Madonna's Web development team will prevent
> unnecessary  change from occurring and focus its resources only on
> beneficial changes within the project scope. 

 

> **DEFINITIONS OF CHANGE** 
>
> There are several types of changes which may be requested and
> considered for Madonna's Web. Depending on the extent and type of
> proposed changes, changes project documentation and the communication
> of these changes will be required to include any approved changes into
> the project plan and ensure all stakeholders are notified. Types of
> changes include: 

 

-   Scheduling Changes: changes which will impact the approved project
    > schedule. These changes may require fast tracking, crashing, or
    > re-baselining the schedule depending on the significance of the
    > impact. 

-   Budget Changes: changes which will impact the approved project
    > budget. These changes may require requesting additional funding,
    > releasing funding which would no longer be required, or adding to
    > project or management reserves. May require changes to the cost
    > baseline. 

-   Scope Changes: changes which are necessary and impact the project's
    > scope which may be the result of unforeseen requirements which
    > were not initially planned for. These changes may also impact
    > budget and schedule. These changes may require revision to WBS,
    > project scope statement, and other project documentation as
    > necessary. 

 

> The project manager must ensure that any approved changes are
> communicated to the project stakeholders. Additionally, as changes are
> approved, the project manager must ensure that the changes are
> captured in the project documentation where necessary. These document
> updates must then be communicated to the project team and stakeholders
> as well. 

 

> **CHANGE CONTROL BOARD** 

 

> The Change Control Board (CCB) is the approval authority for all
> proposed change requests pertaining to Madonna's Web. The purpose of
> the CCB is to review all change requests, determine their impacts on
> the project risk, scope, cost, and schedule, and to approve or deny
> each change request. The following chart provides a list of the CCB
> members for Madonna's Web:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------+

 

> As change requests are submitted to the Project Manager by the project
> team/stakeholders, the Project Manager will log the requests in the
> change log and the CCB will convene every other Friday to review all
> change requests. For a change request to be approved, all CCB members
> must vote in favor. In the event more information is needed for a
> particular change request, the request will be deferred and sent back
> to the requestor for more information or clarification. If a change is
> deemed critical, an ad hoc CCB meeting can be called to review the
> change prior to the next scheduled bi-weekly CCB meeting.

    4.  **Communications Management Plan**

    5.  **Quality Management Plan**

**[Introduction]{.smallcaps} **

The Quality Management Plan for the Madonna's Web project will establish
the activities, processes, and procedures for ensuring a quality product
upon the conclusion of the project.  The purpose of this plan is to: 

-   Ensure quality is planned. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Define how quality will be managed. 

-   Define quality assurance activities. 

-   Define quality control activities. 

-   Define acceptable quality standards. 

 

**[Quality Management Approach]{.smallcaps} **

The quality management approach for the MADONNA'S WEB project will
ensure quality is planned for both the product and processes.  To be
successful, this project will meet its quality objectives by utilizing
an integrated quality approach to define quality standards, measure
quality and continuously improve quality. 

 

Product quality for the MADONNA'S WEB project will be defined by the
company's current standards and criteria for its Resort Management
System.  The focus is on the project's deliverable and the standards and
criteria being used will ensure the product meets established quality
standards and customer satisfaction. 

 

Process quality for the MADONNA'S WEB project will focus on the
processes by which the project deliverable will be manufactured. 
Establishing process quality standards will ensure that all activities
conform to an organizational standard which results in the successful
delivery of the product. 

 

The project team will work with the Quality Group to define and document
all organizational and project specific quality standards for both
product and processes.  All quality documentation will become part of
the MADONNA'S WEB Project Plan and will be transitioned to operations
upon the successful completion of the project. 

 

Metrics will be established and used to measure quality throughout the
project life cycle for the product and processes.  The Quality Group
Manager will be responsible for working with the project team to define
these metrics, conduct measurements, and analyze results.  These product
and process measurements will be used as one criterion in determining
the success of the project and must be reviewed by the project sponsor. 
Metrics will include: 

-   Schedule 

-   Resources 

-   Cost 

-   Process performance 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   System deployment 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Product performance 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   System reliability 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Customer Satisfaction (because of field trials) 

 

Quality improvements will be identified by any member of the project
team or quality group.  Each recommendation will be reviewed to
determine the cost versus benefit of implementing the improvement and
how the improvement will impact the product or processes.  If an
improvement is implemented the project manager will update all project
documentation to include the improvement and the quality manager will
update the organizational documentation the improvement affects. 

 

**[Quality Requirements / Standards]{.smallcaps} **

***Product Quality:*** 

The product quality standards and requirements will be determined by the
project team and quality group.  These standards will primarily be based
on the company's documented standards for the Resort Management System. 
There may be product-specific quality standards identified that are not
currently part of the documented organizational standards.  In this
case, the quality group will review these newly identified standards and
incorporate them into organizational documentation if approved.  The
project team will also document any newly identified quality standards
into the MADONNA'S WEB project plan and ensure communication with all
stakeholders. 

 

As trial products are measured at pre-determined intervals, we will know
that the product is compliant with quality standards once we achieve ten
consecutive trial runs resulting of the system which is 100% within
acceptable quality control margins. 

 

 

***Process Quality:*** 

The process quality standards and requirements will be determined by the
project team and quality group.  Many of these standards will be based
on existing company process standards.  However, it is anticipated that
there will be several unique steps in the manufacturing of the MADONNA'S
WEB product which will require new quality standards.  The MADONNA'S WEB
project team will work with the quality group to establish acceptable
standards and document these standards for incorporation into both
organizational process documents as well as the MADONNA'S WEB project
plan.  These standards will be communicated to all project
stakeholders. 

 

As trial products are created, the process metrics will be measured and
analyzed to determine the quality of the process.  Once the MADONNA'S
WEB product meets quality compliance and all process metrics fall within
acceptable quality assurance margins, we will achieve process compliance
for the MADONNA'S WEB project. 

 

**[Quality Assurance]{.smallcaps}  **

The quality assurance of the MADONNA'S WEB Project focuses on the
processes used in the manufacturing of the MADONNA'S WEB product.  To
ensure quality, an iterative quality process will be used throughout the
project life cycle.  This iterative process includes measuring process
metrics, analyzing process data, and continuously improving the
processes.   

 

The MADONNA'S WEB Project Manager and the project team will perform
assessments at planned intervals throughout the project to ensure all
processes are being correctly implemented and executed.   

 

The quality manager will provide day to day quality management and
conduct process audits on a weekly basis, monitor process performance
metrics, and assure all processes comply with project and organizational
standards.  If discrepancies are found, the quality manager will meet
with the Project Manager and review the identified discrepancies.  

 

The Project Manager will schedule regularly occurring project,
management, and document reviews.  In these reviews, an agenda item will
include a review of project processes, any discrepancies and/or audit
findings from the quality manager, and a discussion on process
improvement initiatives.   

 

Process improvement is another aspect of quality assurance.  Quality
assurance reviews, findings, and assessments should always result in
some form of process improvement and, as a result, product improvement. 
All process improvement efforts must be documented, implemented, and
communicated to all stakeholders as changes are made. 

 

**[Quality Control ]{.smallcaps} **

The quality control of the MADONNA'S WEB project focuses primarily on
the MADONNA'S WEB product and the acceptable standards and performance. 
The quality performance standards for the MADONNA'S WEB Project are in
accordance with the organizational standards of performance of the
Resort Management System.   

 

The project team will perform all tests on their trial systems.  The
characterization group will perform attenuation testing and will provide
the results back to the project team within 3 business days after the
test sample is submitted.  The quality group will ensure all performance
standards are met for each trial cable, perform audits, and assist the
project team with creating or updating all documentation related to
product quality.   

 

The Project Manager will schedule regularly occurring project,
management, and document reviews.  In these reviews, an agenda item will
include a review of products, any discrepancies and/or audit findings
from the quality manager, and a discussion on product improvement
initiatives.   

 

It is imperative to the success of the project that all of the
established physical and performance standards are met.  By doing so,
the MADONNA'S WEB Project Team will ensure that the product achieves the
high level of customer satisfaction anticipated and that future
operational cable production will be in line with budget and resource
allocations.   

 

**[Quality Control Measurements]{.smallcaps} **

All MADONNA'S WEB Project products and processes must be measured and
fall within the established standards and tolerances.  The below logs
will be used by the project and quality teams in conducting these
measurements and will be maintained for use as supporting documentation
for the project's acceptance.

> insights for negotiating favorable prices with suppliers. The project
> team will issue Request for Quotations (RFQs) to potential suppliers,
> outlining the required goods or services and requesting detailed cost
> proposals. The received quotations will be carefully evaluated to
> assess the cost components, including unit prices, taxes, shipping
> charges, and any additional costs. 
>
>  
>
> Cost analysis will be performed to ensure transparency and accuracy in
> the breakdown of costs provided by suppliers. This analysis will
> verify the reasonableness of each cost element and ensure alignment
> with the project\'s budget and objectives. The team will also explore
