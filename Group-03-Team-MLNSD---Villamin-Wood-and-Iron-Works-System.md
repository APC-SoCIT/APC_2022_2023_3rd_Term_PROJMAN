=Company Profile=
<p><strong>Brief Background</strong></p>
<p>Manuel Villamin Jr., owner of Villamin Wood and Iron Works, has been operational since 1983. It is a manufacturing enterprise where products are made to order. They demonstrated their products are from high quality materials. </p>

=Business Case=
==Executive Summary==
<p>lorem ipsum</p>

==Issue==
<p>The issue that arises as a business problem for our client is the decline in sales following the recent pandemic which caused our client to shut down their business for more than 5 months. Not only that but after the pandemic, other businesses started to adapt with innovative technologies and marketing opportunities as businesses were able to cope with changes that benefited the growth of their sales and market through integrating online tools which our client has not maximized and thus resulting to their decline in sales and lack of customer reach. </p>

==Anticipated Outcomes==
<p>Once the project has been implemented, this will by leading to more customer interaction with their business as the online store will add credibility and improve the customer’s online experience and it will also lead into more sales as more orders can be processed at a time with the help of the ordering system. </p> 
<p>The project’s end state will be operated and monitored by the client and will run smoothly as they continue to incorporate their products online and cater to the customer needs faster and in a more convenient manner. </p>
==Recommendation==
<p>lorem ipsum</p>

==Justification==
<p>Applying the system created for Villamin Wood and Iron Works will increase the possibility of expanding their customer reach and increase product sales in comparison to their initial use of Facebook Page. This ordering system will help customers order their desired products even when they are at home or at their workplace. It will provide easy communication between the customer and the client, and an easy transaction for the products or items, this will help Villamin Wood and Iron Works gain more customers and increase their sales continuously without errors or problems. However, this system will not replace their initial page in Facebook, but rather it will help the system to be more advertised and seen by other potential customers. </p>

==Strategic Alignment==
<p>lorem ipsum</p>

==Cost Benefit Analysis==
<p>lorem ipsum</p>

==Alternatives Analysis==
<p>There are other alternatives that the team has put into consideration for the Business's concern. Listed are those alternative solutions alongside with why the team did not lean towards it: </p>

<ul> 1. Focus on the current business process. </ul>
<ul><ul> Though the company and its employees have grown accustomed to their current practice, this method could impose a threat compared to their competitors. As other competitors innovate their way through online platforms, they also increase their chances of attracting customers, and have a well-documented process. If the company were to disregard innovation in marketing, they might find it more difficult to market what they are selling and rely only on what was written. </ul></ul>

<ul> 2. Enhance the company's Facebook page. </ul>
<ul><ul> The client already has a Facebook page, but this limits them from customizing their page in a way that may help them introduce their company to the mass public. </ul></ul>

<ul> 3. Sell products through available ecommerce websites. </ul>
