All quality control measurements will be collected and monitored in real-time on a shared platform. The team will work together to address any issues that arise and implement improvements as needed.

==8.9 Risk Management Plan==
===8.9.1. Introduction===
RAMS Corner Ticketing System aims to modernize and introduce a more efficient and manageable workflow for the Information Technology Resource Office of Asia Pacific College by replacing their current email-based reporting system into a more organized ticketing system that addresses all inquiries or incidents that needs the ITRO expertise.

By following a hybrid model of project lifecycle, this risk management plan will follow specific steps that will be consolidated upon sprints. This includes identifying potential risks, developing quick risk response techniques, controlling, and monitoring the potential risks, that will help the entirety of project to adhere to the allotted time and budget, as well as to mitigate the risk whilst continuing to provide the solution aimed by the project.

This risk management plan will include the risk assessment, risk response, risk control, risk monitoring, while having all these details further reviewed and revised based on the recent technology advancements and how they will affect the execution of the application that will enable the team to mitigate, or minimize  the risk involved in a ticketing system.

===8.9.2. Risk Management Approach===
This risk management plan will follow these steps:

*Risk Identification – this is the first, and most crucial step to be able to analyze the potential risks that will affect the deployment of RAMS Corner Ticketing System greatly. This can include technical problems, Staff problems, customer management problems, or the security problems.

*Risk Assessment – during this step, the prioritization of risk-handling will occur. After identifying the risk, they will be analyzed to see which is most likely to occur. In this sense, the focus of the allotted time and budget can be given to a risk with higher potential. 

*Risk Analysis – after having put the risks in hierarchy, analysis of the possible root causes for these potential risks will undergo this process. This will help in assessing the possible impacts of certain risk factors and update the existing control measures or create a new plan.

*Risk Treatment – once the risks are analyzed one-by-one, an appropriate contingency plan will be created based on the risk factors.

*Risk Monitoring and Review – it is important to keep the risk under control, so the monitoring and review will help in further improving the risk mitigation strategies or the contingency plan based on the different circumstances 

*Communication with the Team and the Stakeholders – regular reporting of progress in risk mitigation will be held so that each and every one of the team members as well as the stakeholders will be informed of what is going on within the system, and what to expect upon the existing risk mitigation procedures.  

*Documentation – lastly is to document all the risk mitigation processes that the project has undergone. It is important to have historical data as a reference if the risk management plan adhered to the rules set to the project.

By following these steps, this will ensure that the RAMS Corner will run smoothly and efficiently, with less-to-no potential risk, and produce a satisfactory result for customer service  that is one of the aims of the project.

===8.9.3. Risk Identification===
Top three Risk in RAMS Corner Ticketing Service System
After identifying the risk, they are categorized intro three major types, these are: 
1.Vulnerabilities in System Security – as a ticketing system, this application will typically handle sensitive information of its customers such as their personal details. A weak authentication system may not be able to withstand data breaches, that will probably cause not only operational losses for the ITRO, but also reputational damage with its clients.

2.System Failure – since a ticketing system acts mainly as a customer support channel, it is very crucial for the RAMS Corner service to be up all the time, especially if it is within school hours. In the instances where the system is down, maybe due to some technical problems or external problems, the inability to cater to the client’s tickets will have a negative impact on the ITRO services as a whole.

3.Performance Issue – this is both true for the hardware and peopleware. A  ticketing system is expected to handle a large volume of tickets, maybe not every day, but to a certain point in time. In that instance, it is possible to have performance issues both with the hardware that is being used (be it crashes, slow response time, etc.), and peopleware issues such as taking a long time resolving one ticket. If the ticketing system and its staff were not able to handle a surge of requests and incidents from their customers, there is the operational and reputational risk for the ITRO. 

To be specific, here are the possible risks that are identified for the RAMS Corner: 

1.Security Breaches – personal information that are stored and is being used in a ticketing system is at risk when there is weak security for the system. 

2.Downtime – system downtime can greatly reduce the trust of the client to the ITRO because they will not be able to raise their concerns timely.

3.Inadequate Scalability and Elasticity – a ticketing system is expected to handle customer support efficiently. If the system is not scalable or elastic enough that it will not be able to handle the increase or decrease in the volume of tickets received daily, the system is bound to produce customer dissatisfaction.

4.Lack of Integration – since RAMS Corner will be adapted by the ITRO, it is expected to be able to integrate well with the current software and hardware equipment that is used by the ITRO, as well as the Asia Pacific College Residents being the clients. Inability to integrate means a decrease in productivity, that will therefore cause operational damage.

To mitigate these aforementioned risks, the team developed a contingency plan that will allow the ITRO to address these issues in a considerable amount of time. Training before deployment is also a necessary step to familiarize the staff with how they are going to navigate the system. A regular reporting of the progress in risk mitigation will also be held in one-week sprints so that the system can remain up to date to the growing risk potentials and the possible ways to minimize it.

===8.9.4. Risk Qualification and Prioritization===
After Identifying the risk for the RAMs Corner, we are able to categorize them based on how likely these risks will occur, and how much are its impact both on the ITRO and their client. We have come up with an impact-probability matrix that can help in prioritizing which type of risk needs a focused mitigation strategy.

In the matrix, the probability of risk occurring, and its impact is described as below:

*Extreme: these are the risks that pose highest level with highly likely to occur and has catastrophic impacts for the ITRO.

*High: these are the risks that pose substantial risk that can lead to disastrous outcomes.

*Medium: these are the risks that has a moderate likelihood of occurrence and can result to negative impacts within the ITRO

*Low: these are the risks that has a lower likelihood of occurrence, but there is still noticeable impact to the ITRO

*Negligible: these are the risks that are not likely to occur and have insignificant impact on the ITRO if it were to happen.

The table below depicts the matrix of impact-probability of the risk identified: 

<img src="https://github.com/apcjlquesada/APC_2022_2023_T3_PROJMAN_MI201_MI203_G04_Nacor_Industries/blob/7067ce2faa21725eebaed7bcc743afdc4b35b429/wikihub%20photos/risk%20assessment.png?raw=true" alt="Image description" style="display:center; margin:0 auto;"><br>
''Table 12: Risk Assessment - Impact-Probability Matrix''

The identified risks are prioritized as follows: 
1.Lack of Integration – Medium probability with significant impact
2.Downtime – medium probability with disastrous impact
3.Inadequate Scalability and Elasticity – medium probability with disastrous impact
4.Security Breaches – medium probability with disastrous impact

After the assessment, we will focus on developing solutions for the risks that are considered in extreme and high priority. The risks on the low to medium priority will be constantly monitored as well, and there are no negligible risks since we firmly believe that all risks must be considered and should have a minimum possible solution whenever they occur.

This risk assessment is subject to revisions after reviews and monitoring. This process will happen during sprint meetings so that all the team members and the stakeholders are up to date with the current risk management plan should there be any changes to be made.

===8.9.5 Risk Monitoring===

Risk monitoring is a very important step in risk management of the RAMs Corner. It will allow the team, as well as the stakeholders, to be involved in the ongoing risk management process that could impact the achievement of the long-term goals of the project. This is also to ensure that the identified and assessed risks are being reviewed and monitored thoroughly so that the ITRO can make informed decisions to make timely actions in preventing or minimizing a risk potential. 

In this step, the project manager and the development team will be the overseer for the risk management. They will be the one responsible for overseeing the ongoing risk mitigation process, continuously monitoring the system logs, security alerts, and performance metrics. They will also provide the team with reviews for user feedback, support ticket, bug reports, and implement Key Performance Indicators to measure how effective is the current risk mitigation. 

They are expected to report on the status of ongoing risk management regularly in every sprint meeting. After the assessment from the report, the team will then collaborate for further reviews if there are risk mitigation plans that should be changed, should be added, or should be maintained.

To sum it all up, having an effective risk monitoring that incorporates the agile methodology, the ITRO can have an early risk detection, which will lead onto improved decision-making when dealing with potential risks, that can also therefore improve the operational efficiency of the system in servicing its clients, and continuous improvement of the system as a whole.

===8.9.6. Risk Mitigation and Avoidance===
As mentioned in the previous risk management plan sections, the risk mitigation will be based upon the identified risk and their prioritization as described in the hierarchy from the risk assessment. The risks labeled as Extreme will be given the highest priority when allocating resources, down until the risks labeled Low. This step will allow the  team to have an overview of the suitable mitigation plan per assessed risks while continuing to improve, monitor, and review the overall health of the system.

The following are the available mitigation plan that is ongoing or to be implemented: 
*Contingency Plan – It is important to develop contingency plans that outline the steps that should be taken should there be any security mishaps or some kind of operational disturbance within the system. To make sure that there is an effective contingency plan, the project manager will supervise all of the development and execution phase of the project. 
*Regular Assessments and Audits – It is also absolutely crucial that there is a periodic review of the current plans. This will be attained by applying the Hybrid(Waterfall-Agile) Methodology, wherein the team must follow the specific steps in risk management while also submitting reports regarding monitoring and reviewing of currently implemented actions every sprint meeting.
*Implement robust access controls – while the users are already defined for the RAMS Corner, it is still imperative to have a definite access control to ensure that there would be no unauthorized access to the ticketing system. This will include user authentication, requiring using strong passwords, role-based access controls, and periodic access reviews by the assigned ITRO Staff.
*System Backups – consistency in backing up the RAMS Corner data must be implemented to ensure that there will be no information and data loss in an event of system failure, data corruption, and some unforeseen circumstances should occur. Reviewing the restoration process and verifying integrity of the back-up data must also be included in the regular assessments.
*Employee Training – provide a detailed training plan for the employees regarding the use and management of the RAMS Corner Ticketing Service System so that the staffs are educated on the proper handling of tickets, as well as providing them the details for the risk mitigation should there be any threats occur within the system or when using the system.
*Regular Communication – while all other technical aspects are important, communication within the team is also important to ensure that every stakeholder is informed regarding the ongoing plans, especially when tackling about the risk that the system is facing. This is to make sure that no resources are lost while still maintaining the efficacy of the system.
*Change Management Plan – there must be a distinct change management plan for when there are any changes that need to be made to the system. It is important to document and gain the approval of every stakeholder when applying changes within the project. This will allow the team to handle potential risks without creating any ambivalence within the project stakeholders’ ideas.

===8.9.7. Risk Register===
In the risk register section, the risk management plan that will be intended for the top categories of identified risks will be constantly revised throughout the project. This will include all necessary details such as the probability of these risks occurring, their impacts, and the mitigation and avoidance procedures.

The risk registry will be available for viewing for all the stakeholders to make sure that there is transparency when it comes to risk management. This file will be kept in a shared location where all the stakeholders can access it. 

The aim for this risk register is to allow the stakeholders, especially the team, to have an overview of the history of risk management planning for comparison and improvement basis, as well as the ongoing measures taken for risk mitigation. In this way, the RAMS Corner project team will be able to manage the potential risks in a timely and efficient manner. 

The following are the list of elements in the Risk Register
*Risk ID – each risk identified will have their own unique identifier
*Risk Description – brief and concise description of the identified risk
*Risk Category – classify the type of risk as Vulnerability in Security, System Failure, and Performance Issues
*Risk Owner – project team member that is responsible for monitoring and reviewing current potential risks
*Probability – probability of risk occurrence scaling from 1 – 4, 1 indicating Very Low Probability and 5 indicating High probability
*Impact – impact of the potential risk scaling from 1-5, 1 having Insignificant impact, and 5 having the Catastrophic impact
*Risk Score – product of probability and impact score
*Mitigation Procedure – specific measures intended for the listed potential risk
*Status – historical status of the risk. It can be Open, Ongoing, or Closed.
*Target Resolution Date – date for the resolution of the listed risk.

==8.10 Procurement Plan==
===8.10.1. Introduction===
The procurement management plan plays a vital role in the making of RAMs Corner: ITRO Ticketing Service System. It serves as a guide and outlines to make all the things needed to make the software run smoothly. It will justify why using up to date technologies are needed. The procurement management plan will be revised or updated from time to time in case there has been a change in obtaining the necessary materials. Along with this paper, it will also include all the possible risks and will layout its mitigation plan, different types of contracts that will be used, and cost determination.

The procurement management plan outlines all the critical scenarios that are relevant to make the project successful. It will help align all the necessary deliverables to avoid delaying things and keep them on track.

===8.10.2. Procurement Risks===
All activities have their own risks. This includes procuring all the materials needed, goods, or any services that would be vital in making the project successful and deployable.
The Nacor Industries should plan ahead how to avoid or mitigate the damage a possible risk can cause. The team identified all the possible scenarios that should be considered when procuring all the necessary materials. The list below shows all the possible angles that can happen but not limited to:  
1. Failure to deliver all the materials within the project timeline causing delays and higher cost of budget.
2. Receiving not properly integrated hardware resulting in frequent maintenance and poor customer service.
3. Incorrect or lack of research about certain products which may lead to buying wrong materials which can also cause to increase budget.
4. Having a contract with a vendor that doesn’t meet the industry standard may impact not only the project’s reputation, but also the company.
5. Having poor communication between the team and the vendor acquiring more than enough resources which can cause higher cost of budget without fully utilizing all the materials bought. 

This part of the paper is simultaneously updated to keep track of the updated possible risks that can have an impact on the project. This will be updated from time to time throughout the project’s lifetime to ensure quality output when launching the finished project.

===8.10.3. Procurement Risk Management===
1.Identification of procurement risks
For the company to plan out and mitigate the risk. The company should first take the risk. The possible procurement management risk for the Nacor Industries is below but not limited to:
*Delayed delivery of materials
*Having sub-standard materials
*Lack of materials coming from the same vendor
*Sudden inflation of materials causing higher costs

2. Risk mitigation strategies 
After listing all the possible scenarios that can happen when procuring the materials. It is important to establish how to apply certain strategies and how to implement them. 
*Have the deliveries advanced for a few days so that there is an ample amount of time in case of delays.
*After looking for a specific product. Look for an alternative without sacrificing the quality to avoid unexpected breakdown of the material/s. 
*Look for a back-up vendor that also provides the same resources in case the other vendor is out of products
*Increase the budget by a few percentages to cover for the materials in case the prices increase. 

3. Assignment of Responsibilities
Everyone will have their own responsibilities when managing the procuring risks. Specific individuals will be assigned to pinpoint the procuring risks and others will be assigned to determine a possible risk that has been overlooked. Further to that information, the project manager and people who are assigned those responsibilities will be providing feedback on the status of the procurement risk management plans.

4. Communication and Reporting
Proper communication within the team or group is the key essential to success of the project. Regular status reports will be provided by the Project manager and the project team, Procurement risks and risk mitigation will be constantly updated, and the stakeholders would be informed when changes or developments happen in procuring risk management activities.

5. Continuous Improvement 
Since procurement risk management is continuously updated, the documents will be saved and used as a future reference when dealing with a certain risk. This would greatly help the future projects to improve on how they will execute their tasks and provide even more quality outputs.  
Regular analysis of the procurement risk will also be conducted in case a certain risk has been overlooked by the project manager and the project team.

===8.10.4. Cost Determination===
Just like any project, Cost determination is also a crucial part of the project when procuring the essential materials. The project needs to have a high-quality product and be cost effective at the same time. To guarantee this situation, the company may bid on vendors who offers the best deal that would benefit the project.

The project team must review all the costs surrounding the procurement process. This goes from delivery of items to the installation of the said items, and the maintenance costs to keep the materials up and running. During this time around, the team would thoroughly review any potential cost overruns so that they might look for an alternative so that the budget for procuring materials cannot be affected that much and mitigate the possible risks that can happen.
	
Stakeholders, project manager, procurement manager would then collaborate to guarantee that the budget would be utilized and no resources in making the project successful would go to waste. The procurement budget is also constantly monitored and kept on track to avoid going over the budget.

To make things fast and efficient, the project team will use standardized procurement templates. This would greatly help the team to be constant on the method they are using when calculating costs on different angles of procurement activities.
Cost determination plays a huge role in procurement management plans as it serves as a guide to make sure the budget for the project is correct and utilized well. 

===8.10.5. Procurement Constraints===
The constraints below should be considered as a part of the RAMS Corner: Ticketing Service System project. 

::1.Schedule constraints: Every project has a strict deadline including the RAMs Corner: Ticketing Service System project. The deliverables should be made based on their deadline or planned schedule. It is important that individuals pass their deliverables on time to avoid any delays to the project and to ensure the team stays on the right track. Any delays within the deliverables might cause the problem to snowball into bigger issues that can affect the project itself.

::2.Budget constraints: the project has an allotted budget for the project. 

::3.Technology Constraints: The software that Nacor Industries makes (RAMS Corner: ITRO Ticketing Service System) does not demand a higher specification for it to run. A typical office computer/desktop can suffice for the software to run smoothly.

::4.Resource constraints: The personnel of the office should be knowledgeable of how to operate or use the newly made software for them.

===8.10.6. Contract Approval Process===
The contract approval process for the ITRO will be formally handled by the director of the office. The team will formally conduct a meeting with the director and present the idea. The team and the director would then start the process of conducting the contract and make sure no policies are bypassed.

::1.Contract initiation: the project manager would first pitch the idea to the head of the ITRO. 

::2.Contract planning. The director of the ITRO would then make suggestions or customized features that would personally cater to the needs of the office.

::3.Contract development: once the contract is set and ready. The team would develop the software and would have a meeting with the client regarding about the status of the software

::4.Contract Review: the director and the team would review the software to make sure the project is still within the scope

===8.10.7. Decision Criteria===
The following decision criteria for the Nacor Industries are the following:
Technical capabilities: the vendor must have ample experience in handling any similar projects of the same nature. This is important for the project to succeed. It is also important to note that the vendor is knowledgeable in today’s technology

Price: The price is one of the deciding factors whether a company would buy the vendor’s product or not. If the vendor would set its prices high. The materials should meet the quality and certain specifications for it to be reasonable.

Schedule: The vendor should be able to deliver its expected quality output within the given schedule.
Quality: The vendor should be able to meet the specifications and quality of the materials. The vendor should also be able to consistently provide customer service.

Risk management: the vendor should have a plan to mitigate every risk that may be possibly encountered over the lifetime of the project.

Sustainability: the vendor should be able to sustain the product he/she sells. The materials should also be economic making it easier to build and sustain the products

Compliance: the vendor should abide the laws and have no past issues that possibly taint the project’s name and the company’s name

===8.10.8. Performance Metrics for Procurement Activities===
The following metrics that will be used for procurement activities are:

:1.Vendor performance rating
::A. The project manager and the project sponsor would thoroughly review the product of the vendor's product. In this way, this gives the team a much better point of view since there are people vouching for the product of the vendor.

:2.Procurement cycle time  
::A. These measures the vendor’s capabilities or how fast and efficient it is when delivering the items. This starts from the initial ordering of the materials to finishing the project from installing the delivered goods.

:3.Cost variance.
::A. This metric serves as a purpose to scout the market on the lowest price possible on certain materials. This gives the company a lot of choices settling between couples of vendors who have the best deal possible.

:4.Purchase Order Accuracy: 
::A. This metric tests the vendor’s accuracy when delivering the materials in a large quantity. One wrong item can possibly cause a delay in a project. 

===8.10.9 Procurement Management Approach===
The project manager will handle and manage all the things needed to be obtained for the project. The project manager will brainstorm together with the team to discuss all the recent technologies on the market that would potentially help the software to run smoothly. The project manager and the team would then review the materials that are listed for further inspection and look for some alternatives to save budget without sacrificing the quality of the materials. After the meeting, the project manager would then decide if the lists were valid and reasonable to buy. 
After making the list of necessary materials for the project, the project would then look for a suitable supplier to either buy or start having a contract with the store. 

==8.11 Implementation Plan==
===8.11.9. Schedule===
Throughout the project’s lifetime, the team is able to submit all deliverables needed. Each work that was assigned to each member has a specific deadline to help the team estimate how many resources will be needed to finish all the needed tasks before proceeding. 

To create the project schedule, the team used software named ‘Open Project’ to create a Gantt Chart. In this Gantt Chart, all the activities and deliverables are listed and recorded. In this way, it is much easier to monitor the project’s growth over time.

See Figures for reference of the start and end date of deliverables for project schedule.

===8.11.1. Executive Summary===
The RAMs Corner: ITRO Ticketing Service System is complete, and as a part of the project closeout, a transition plan is being developed to ensure that when the project team handover the system to its project client, it will be a seamless system turnover. The purpose of this is to provide an overview of the transition phases, which includes the system current state or to check if it is under the minimum viable product, and how it is planned to transition from project team to the project client.

RAMs Corner: ITRO Ticketing Service System was developed by Nacor Industries in collaboration with Mr. Jose Castillo of the ITRO department office, the project client. The system has been ongoing and under development for the past 5 months, starting from December for UI/UX Designing, and expected to finish in July, which finalizes the overall project from providing a working and deployable Ticketing Service System.

The project client will receive a deployable system that is stable and operational, all the functionalities and features have been validated and undergone various test cases. As the team transition the system to the client, the team aims to provide them with necessary documentation of the Ticketing Service System to ensure that the client will manage the system properly.

The project team will provide all the technical documentation, user manuals, and source code to ensure that the project client will have a comprehensive understanding of the system once it has been turned over to them. The project client will oversee the maintenance and troubleshooting as their scope of work encompasses these things. 

Overall, once the transition phase of the system from project team to the project client is done, the project client will be receiving a fully operational Ticketing Service System, and that project team completed all the objectives and requirements set before the development and deployment of the application.
