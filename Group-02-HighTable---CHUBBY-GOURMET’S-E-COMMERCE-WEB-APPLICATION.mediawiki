<h2>Brief Background:</h2>
<p>Insert text here</p>

=Business Case=
==Executive Summary==
<p>This section will give an overview of what issue the project is trying to solve, the anticipated outcomes to expect, recommendations on who to approach and solve the issue, and justifications as to why the project should be implemented for the client. </p>

<p>After the global pandemic struck COVID-19 and social distance was enforced strictly across the country, businesses were forced to come up with new ways of being able to serve their customers. Whether it be by implementing an online e-commerce system, implementing a non-contact delivery system, etc. Either way, these kinds of solutions will always be a struggle to gain an edge for local micro-to-small enterprises such as Chubby Gourmet. Chubby Gourmet (established in 2020) is a micro-enterprise that focuses on offering their food products via delivery and is stationed within the village of Laguna Bel Air 1, Sta. Rosa Laguna.  </p>

<h3>Issue</h3>
<p>HighTable was fortunate enough to meet with the business owner, Priscilla Mariano, to assess and discuss the problems surrounding her business. The main issue that was discovered was her current system, which is manually doing tasks such as order taking, which she needs to manually note down via pen and paper through getting her customer’s order via Facebook Messenger. Another problem found in their current system was the inventory management of her ingredients, food containers, etc. The last problem Miss Mariano stated was that she had to constantly keep answering individual frequently asked questions from her customers, since her Facebook page does not have a Frequently Asked Questions portion. </p>

<p>Overall, all of these tasks take up most of her time before even cooking the orders from her customers which causes a concern for her in the long run of her business. She wishes to find a more efficient way of handling orders, transactions, inventory management, and answering queries all in one platform. </p>

<h3>Anticipated Outcomes</h3>
<p>With the issues stated above, HighTable wishes to establish the following anticipated outcomes of the solution: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve process problems found within Chubby Gourmet by implementing an E-commerce web application.</li>
  <li>Continuously improving and adjusting the project to the client’s needs with little-to-no issue</li>
  <li>Gain client satisfaction with little-to-no corrections needed</li>
</ul>  
<p>These anticipated outcomes will be guided by the client’s constant feedback, the group’s advisor, and thorough communication within the group. </p>

<h3>Recommendation</h3>
<p>With the issues stated above, HighTable recommends implementing an e-commerce web application to help Chubby Gourmet. Upon entering the web application, the user will be able to see and use the following features: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Product Management (Admin Side) </li>
  <li>Order Management (Admin Side) </li>
  <li>Inventory Management (Admin Side)</li>
  <li>Generation of Reports (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Print Reports (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Customer Account Creation (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Shopping Cart (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Checkout (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Payment (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Delivery Schedule (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Order Tracking (Customer and Admin Side)</li>
  <li>Catering Schedule (Customer Side)</li>
</ul>  
<p>With these features suggested, the web application will be able to achieve the anticipated outcomes that the group has established and may even continue to improve further if needed. </p>

<h3>Justification</h3>
<p>The reason as to why this solution will be applicable for Chubby Gourmet is because in today’s standards, the world has adapted to using online commerce more and has become a new normal in the current market. By implementing the e-commerce web application, this allows Chubby Gourmet to establish their brand and services online for the public and allows HighTable to exercise their skills in developing a project that will meet the needs of the client through technical skills such as web development. </p>

==Problem Definition==
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Chubby Gourmet is a one-woman food business located in Laguna, Philippines, which faces several difficulties in managing its operations. The business owner struggles to handle customer inquiries, accept orders, and track inventory due to limited resources and staff. Specifically, the business owner has trouble organizing orders received via Facebook Messenger, keeping track of inventory, and answering the same set of customer questions repeatedly, leading to a time-consuming and inefficient process. To address these challenges, the business needs an improved system that can streamline operations, provide a better customer experience, and allow the owner to focus on delivering quality food to customers. </p>

<h3>Organizational Impact </h3>
<p>The proposed e-commerce web application will bring a significant impact to the business processes of Chubby Gourmet. The new system will allow the business owner to handle customer inquiries and orders more efficiently and effectively, which will lead to a more streamlined process. Additionally, the online platform will allow customers to place their orders more conveniently and receive faster service. This will lead to an enhanced customer experience and increased customer satisfaction. With an automated system, Chubby Gourmet can focus on serving quality food and growing the business, rather than spending a significant amount of time on administrative tasks.  </p>

<h3>Technology Migration </h3>
<p>The proposed e-commerce web application for Chubby Gourmet will be developed using PHP and SQL technology. The web application will be hosted on Hostinger, a reliable and secure web hosting server. The data migration process will ensure that all relevant data is carried over to the new system. The new system will undergo extensive testing to ensure its reliability, efficiency, and security. Technical requirements and potential obstacles will be addressed during the development process to ensure a successful implementation. Chubby Gourmet's admin will receive instructions from developers to use the new system effectively and to take full advantage of its features, leading to a more streamlined and efficient process. </p>

==Project Overview==
<p>This section will discuss high-level information about Chubby Gourmet’s e-commerce Web Application including its description, goals and objectives, performance criteria, assumptions, constraints, and milestones.  This section will also provide all project-specific information that will help in the contribution of the project. </p>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>HighTable intends to implement an e-commerce web application in Chubby Gourmet’s current system. The web application would have the usual e-commerce functionalities, all the while adding a mobile app version for the mobile users to gain access to. </p>
<p>The project will be managed/executed using the agile methodology because the group sees this method as an effective method to accomplish tasks efficiently. HighTable has been using this method to accomplish previous tasks for the past three terms and will continue to use it throughout the duration of the production of the project. </p>
<p>The general purpose as to why this project is being conducted is because not only is HighTable accomplishing this for their pre-requisite deliverable for BSIT, but they see it as a need to help micro-to-small enterprises like Chubby Gourmet to excel in the field they work in. </p>

<h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
<p>HighTable intends to accomplish this project as effectively as possible and to help improve the current system Chubby Gourmet is using. These are the following specific objectives that the group must accomplish: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Organize customer orders faster by 80%, which contains details such as personal information, orders, and transaction details.</li>
  <li>Digitize 100% of the inventory management allowing an easier way of tracking (add, update, delete) current inventory.</li>
  <li>Display answers to common queries from customers with two (2) to three (3) clicks, so that Chubby Gourmet could spend less time answering questions every day. </li>
</ul>  

<h3>Project Performance</h3>
<p>The group will gauge the project’s performance by reviewing and evaluating the following documents filled out upon testing by both the developers and the client: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Test Case </li>
</ul>  
<p>Under this document is where the developers of the group test each of the features developed and used a “PASS” or “FAIL” status on each of the features, noting down all possible scenarios to stress test the feature. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Web Performance Objectives </li>
</ul>  
<p>Written by Cassone et. Al, in the document entitled “Web Performance Testing and Measurement: a complete approach”, they were able to come up with three main objectives with sub-objectives that can be followed when evaluating the performance of a web application. </p>

<ul>
  <li>End-User Objectives
<ul>
  <li>To find average response time of pages and transactions, slowest and fastest pages; </li>
  <li>To make sure main pages (e.g. landing page) can be downloaded within acceptable time  </li>
  <li>To find out maximum number of concurrent users, sessions and transactions that the application is able to support still providing a high level of service and without the system crashing </li>
<li>To characterize more frequent user paths, the most used starting and exiting page; </li>
  <li>To identify main reasons of site abandonment </li>
</ul>  
</li>
  <li>System Objectives
<ul>
  <li>To correlate system resource utilization with load; </li>
  <li>To find out possible actual hardware bottlenecks and prevent new ones (capacity planning); </li>
  <li>To tune all the web application components to support as much load as possible using actual hardware; </li>
<li>To find out how the application works when overloaded; </li>
</ul>  
</li>
  <li>Management Obejctives
<ul>
  <li>To provide an objective measure of the usage of the site (e.g. the amount of electronics carts and number of items that were sold) </li>
  <li>To provide a “business view” of the previous data (Comparing with the business’ previous system)   </li>
</ul>  
</li>
</ul>  
<p>The group will gauge the project’s performance by reviewing and evaluating the following documents and objectives filled out upon testing by both the developers and the stakeholders. </p>

==Cost Benefit Analysis==
<p>This section of the paper presents a cost-benefit analysis for the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the financial feasibility of the project, considering both the costs and the expected benefits of the proposed system. The results of the analysis will help to determine whether the project is a worthwhile investment for the client. </p>

<p>Benefits:<br>The Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application could offer several benefits to the client once fully implemented, including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The client can potentially increase their sales revenue by reaching a wider audience, which is estimated to be x0.5 of the current sales allowing them to better showcase their products and services, and providing an easier purchasing experience for customers; </li>
  <li>With an integrated e-commerce platform, the client can streamline their operations, reducing their overall operating costs by consolidating their marketing, sales, and payment processing functions onto a single platform; </li>
  <li>With a more user-friendly and seamless e-commerce platform, customers are more likely to become repeat customers, leading to better overall customer experience; and </li>
<li>By utilizing an e-commerce platform, the client can expand their reach beyond their physical store location, tapping into new geographic markets and demographic segments that were previously untapped. </li>
</ul>  

<p>Costs:<br>The Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project has the following costs associated with it: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Hosting for the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project is estimated to cost ₱99.00. </li>
  <li>The cost of the domain for the project is estimated at ₱908.00. </li>
  <li>The internet fee, which includes the cost of high-speed internet access required for the project's development and implementation, is expected to amount to ₱20,388.00. </li>
<li>The other expenses for the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project amount to ₱92,085.00 per year, covering electricity, ingredients, water, gas, and other operational costs necessary for the successful and efficient running of the e-commerce platform. </li>
</ul>  

<p>The total cost of the project is ₱113,453.00 per year. </p>

<p>It is important to note that the costs associated with development and maintenance are excluded from the analysis as the project is being undertaken for academic purposes and not for commercial gain. Additionally, contingency costs are also not included as they are part of the development process. </p>

<p>The cost difference between the current system and the proposed project is not significant since the existing devices and operational expenses can be used for the new system. However, the potential benefits of the project, such as increased reach and sales revenue, are expected to be significant due to the expanded customer base and improved user experience offered by the project. </p>

<p>The cost-benefit analysis indicates that pursuing the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project is worth pursuing for the business. While there will be initial costs associated with hosting, domain, internet and electricity fees, as well as operational expenses, the potential benefits of the project such as increased sales revenue, and improved customer experience and retention, are expected to outweigh the initial investment in the long run. </p>

=Stakeholders Management Strategy Plan=

=Scope Management Plan=

=Cost Management Plan=
==Introduction==
<p>Effective cost management is crucial for the success of any project, and the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project is no exception. This Cost Management Plan document outlines the strategies and procedures that will be employed to ensure that project costs are managed efficiently and effectively throughout its lifecycle. </p>
<p>The purpose of this plan is to establish the guidelines and standards for measuring, controlling, and reporting project costs. The plan identifies the individuals responsible for cost management, defines the authority levels for approving changes to the project budget, and outlines the mechanisms for measuring and reporting cost performance. </p>
<p>By adhering to the standards set out in this plan, we can ensure that the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project is completed within budget, on time, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.</p>

==Cost Management Approach==
<p>The Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project will utilize the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to effectively manage costs. As the project management team does not have a Project Management Information System, costs will be managed at the last level of each WBS activity, it can either be third, fourth, or fifth level of the WBS. This level of granularity strikes a balance between detailed cost management and manageable effort. </p>
<p>At the last level of each WBS activity, Cost Accounts will be established for each major deliverable. Each Cost Account will be assigned a budget, and actual costs will be tracked against this budget. To ensure effective cost management, a Cost Account Manager will be designated for each Cost Account. They will be responsible for managing the costs associated with their respective Cost Account. </p>
<p>Cost performance will be monitored by regularly reviewing actual costs against the budgeted costs for each Cost Account. Any variances will be thoroughly investigated, and corrective actions will be taken as necessary. Additionally, a cost performance index (CPI) and a schedule performance index (SPI) will be utilized to track cost and schedule performance. Monthly reports will be generated and presented to the Project Sponsor and other key stakeholders. </p>
<p>All changes to the project scope or budget will require review and approval by the Project Manager and the Project Sponsor. If a cost change exceeds 10% of the total project budget, approval from the Project Sponsor will be necessary before implementation. </p>
<p>By managing costs at the last level of the WBS and regularly reviewing cost performance, the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application project will be completed within the approved budget and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders. </p>

==Measuring Project Costs==
<p>This section will detail the Earned Value measurements that will be captured and reported upon, and whether any tools, such as project management software, will be used to assist in capturing Earned Value metrics. The section will also outline how future project costs will be forecasted and how cost performance will be reviewed over time, across work packages or schedule activities. </p>
<p>Forecasting future project costs is an important aspect of cost management in any project. In the cost management plan for Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application, the project team will use a combination of historical data and expert judgment to forecast future project costs. The team will also consider any changes in project scope, schedule, or resource requirements that may affect the project budget. </p>
<p>To review cost performance across work packages or schedule activities, the team will analyze the data collected through the EVM measurements and identify the areas where the project is over or under budget. The team will then drill down to the specific work packages or activities that are causing the deviations and take corrective actions accordingly. This will help the team keep the project on track and prevent any cost overruns or schedule delays. </p>
<p>To review cost performance over time, the team will use the earned value management (EVM) approach and measure Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Variance (CV), Schedule Performance Index (SPI), and Cost Performance Index (CPI) regularly. These measurements will help the team identify any deviations from the budget and schedule and take corrective actions to keep the project on track. </p>
<p>Schedule Variance (SV) will be used to measure the schedule performance of the project. It will be calculated by taking the Earned Value (EV) and subtracting the Planned Value (PV). If SV is zero, the project is perfectly on schedule. If SV is greater than zero, the project is ahead of schedule. If SV is less than zero, the project is behind schedule. </p>
<p>Cost Variance (CV) will be used to measure the budget performance of the project. It will be calculated by subtracting Actual Costs (AC) from Earned Value (EV). If the CV is zero, the project is perfectly on budget. If the CV is greater than zero, the project is under budget. If the CV is less than zero, the project is over budget. </p>
<p>The Schedule Performance Index (SPI) will measure the progress achieved against what was planned. SPI will be calculated as EV/PV. A well-performing project should have its SPI as close to 1 as possible, or maybe even a little under 1. </p>
<p>The Cost Performance Index (CPI) will measure the value of the work completed compared to the actual cost of the work completed. CPI will be calculated as EV/AC. If the CPI is greater than 1, the project is under budget. If it's less than 1, the project is over budget. If CPI is equal to 1, the project is perfectly on budget. </p>

==Reporting Format==
<p>The reporting format for the cost management plan of the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application will be a monthly report presented by the Project Manager to the stakeholders. The report should be easily understandable and accessible to all stakeholders, including the project team, stakeholders, and management. </p>
<p>The report will include the following elements: </p>
<p>Cost Summary 
<br>
A summary of the project's status in terms of the cost, including the total project cost, the cost incurred to date, and the cost forecast for the remainder of the project.</p>
<p>Budget Overview 
<br>
A detailed breakdown of the project's budget, including the cost of each phase or deliverable, and the costs associated with each project resource (e.g., labor, equipment, etc.). </p>
<p>Cost Variance Analysis 
<br>
A detailed analysis of any variances between the project's actual costs and the budgeted costs for the month. This should include a detailed explanation of the causes of the variances, the impact on the project, and any actions taken to address them. </p>
<p>Budget Forecast 
<br>
A projection of the project's future costs, including any potential cost variances and their potential impact on the project. </p>
<p>Cost Management Metrics 
<br>
A set of key performance indicators that provide a snapshot of the project's cost performance, including cost variance, cost performance index (CPI), and schedule performance index (SPI). </p>
<p>Risks and Opportunities 
<br>
A summary of the identified risks and opportunities related to the cost of the project, including any updates to the risk and opportunity register. </p>
<p>Change Requests 
<br>
A summary of any approved or pending change requests related to the cost of the project. </p>
<p>Approval and Sign-off 
<br>
A section for the project manager and other key stakeholders to review, approve, and sign off on the cost management report. </p>

==Cost Variance Response==
<p>The Cost Variance Response Process for the Chubby Gourmet E-commerce Web Application project is outlined below: </p>
<p>Identify the Cost Variance 
<br>
The project team will monitor and track all costs incurred and compare them to the budgeted costs. If the actual costs exceed the budgeted costs by a predetermined threshold, a cost variance will be identified. </p>
<p>Analyze the Cost Variance 
<br>
The project team will analyze the cost variance to determine the root cause(s) of the deviation. This may involve a review of the project plan, a breakdown of cost components, and consultations with stakeholders. </p>
<p> 
Develop Options 
<br>
Based on the analysis, the project team will develop a range of options to address the cost variance. These may include reducing scope, changing resource allocations, renegotiating contracts, or seeking additional funding. </p>
<p>Evaluate Options 
<br>
The project team will evaluate the options in terms of feasibility, effectiveness, and impact on the project objectives. The options will be presented to the project sponsor or other decision-makers for approval. </p>
<p>Implement Chosen Option 
<br>
Once the chosen option is approved, the project team will implement the corrective action. This may involve revising the project plan, and reallocating resources. </p>
<p>Monitor Progress 
<br>
The project team will continue to monitor and track costs to ensure that the corrective action is effective in addressing the cost variance. If necessary, additional corrective actions may be taken to further mitigate the cost variance. </p>
<p>Communicate Status 
<br>
The project team will provide regular updates on the status of the cost variance and any corrective actions taken to stakeholders, including the project sponsor, management, and other relevant parties.</p>

==Cost Change Control Process==
<p>The Cost Change Control Process for the Chubby Gourmet e-commerce web application will be as follows: </p>
<p>Request for Cost Change 
<br>
Any proposed changes to the project budget or costs must be submitted to the project manager in writing using the Cost Change Request Form. </p>
<p>Initial Assessment 
<br>
The project manager will review the Cost Change Request Form and perform an initial assessment to determine the potential impact on the project budget, schedule, scope, and quality. </p>
<p>Analysis of the Cost Change 
<br>
The project manager will analyze the Cost Change Request in consultation with the project team to determine the feasibility, risks, and benefits of the proposed change. </p>
<p>Cost Change Approval 
<br>
The project manager will submit the Cost Change Request along with the analysis and recommendations to the project sponsor for approval. The project sponsor will review the request and either approve or reject it based on the impact analysis and the project's objectives and constraints. </p>
<p>Implementation of the Cost Change 
<br>
Once approved, the project manager will implement the Cost Change in accordance with the approved plan and schedule. This may involve updating the project management plan, revising the budget, reallocating resources, changing the project scope or quality, or updating the risk management plan. </p>
<p>Cost Change Monitoring 
<br>
The project manager will monitor the Cost Change to ensure that it is implemented as per the approved plan and schedule. The project team will track the cost performance and schedule performance to identify any variances or deviations from the plan and take corrective actions as necessary. </p>
<p>Reporting on the Cost Change 
<br>
The project manager will report the Cost Change in the regular project status reports to the project sponsor, and other stakeholders as appropriate. The report will include the approved Cost Change Request, the analysis and recommendations, the implementation plan and schedule, the monitoring and control plan, and any other relevant financial data. </p>
