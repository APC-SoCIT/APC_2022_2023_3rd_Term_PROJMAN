<h2>Brief Background:</h2>
<p>Insert text here</p>

=Business Case=
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This section will give an overview of what issue the project is trying to solve, the anticipated outcomes to expect, recommendations on who to approach and solve the issue, and justifications as to why the project should be implemented for the client. </p>

<p>After the global pandemic struck COVID-19 and social distance was enforced strictly across the country, businesses were forced to come up with new ways of being able to serve their customers. Whether it be by implementing an online e-commerce system, implementing a non-contact delivery system, etc. Either way, these kinds of solutions will always be a struggle to gain an edge for local micro-to-small enterprises such as Chubby Gourmet. Chubby Gourmet (established in 2020) is a micro-enterprise that focuses on offering their food products via delivery and is stationed within the village of Laguna Bel Air 1, Sta. Rosa Laguna.  </p>

<h3>Issue</h3>
<p>HighTable was fortunate enough to meet with the business owner, Priscilla Mariano, to assess and discuss the problems surrounding her business. The main issue that was discovered was her current system, which is manually doing tasks such as order taking, which she needs to manually note down via pen and paper through getting her customer’s order via Facebook Messenger. Another problem found in their current system was the inventory management of her ingredients, food containers, etc. The last problem Miss Mariano stated was that she had to constantly keep answering individual frequently asked questions from her customers, since her Facebook page does not have a Frequently Asked Questions portion. </p>

<p>Overall, all of these tasks take up most of her time before even cooking the orders from her customers which causes a concern for her in the long run of her business. She wishes to find a more efficient way of handling orders, transactions, inventory management, and answering queries all in one platform. </p>

<h3>Anticipated Outcomes</h3>
<p>With the issues stated above, HighTable wishes to establish the following anticipated outcomes of the solution: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve process problems found within Chubby Gourmet by implementing an E-commerce web application.</li>
  <li>Continuously improving and adjusting the project to the client’s needs with little-to-no issue</li>
  <li>Gain client satisfaction with little-to-no corrections needed</li>
</ul>  
<p>These anticipated outcomes will be guided by the client’s constant feedback, the group’s advisor, and thorough communication within the group. </p>

<h3>Recommendation</h3>
<p>With the issues stated above, HighTable recommends implementing an e-commerce web application to help Chubby Gourmet. Upon entering the web application, the user will be able to see and use the following features: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Product Management (Admin Side) </li>
  <li>Order Management (Admin Side) </li>
  <li>Inventory Management (Admin Side)</li>
  <li>Generation of Reports (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Print Reports (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Customer Account Creation (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Shopping Cart (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Checkout (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Payment (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Delivery Schedule (Customer Side) </li>
  <li>Order Tracking (Customer and Admin Side)</li>
  <li>Catering Schedule (Customer Side)</li>
</ul>  
<p>With these features suggested, the web application will be able to achieve the anticipated outcomes that the group has established and may even continue to improve further if needed. </p>

<h3>Justification</h3>
<p>The reason as to why this solution will be applicable for Chubby Gourmet is because in today’s standards, the world has adapted to using online commerce more and has become a new normal in the current market. By implementing the e-commerce web application, this allows Chubby Gourmet to establish their brand and services online for the public and allows HighTable to exercise their skills in developing a project that will meet the needs of the client through technical skills such as web development. </p>
