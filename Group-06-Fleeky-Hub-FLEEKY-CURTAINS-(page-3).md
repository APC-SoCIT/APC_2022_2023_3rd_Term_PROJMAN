</ol>


<h2>Scope Management Approach</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Authority and responsibility for scope management will be held by the Project Manager, Pallas Fontiveros, who will work closely with the Project Sponsor, Ms. Mitzi Garcia, and other key stakeholders to define and manage the scope of the project. 
</li>
<li>
To determine the scope of the project, a Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, and a comprehensive Statement of Work (SOW) will be developed. These documents will precisely specify the project's objectives, activities, and prerequisites, and will undergo evaluation and endorsement by the project sponsor and other involved parties prior to commencing the work. 
</li>
<li>
The project's extent will be evaluated and confirmed using quality checklists, measurements of work performance, and regular monitoring of the project's advancement in relation to the original scope. If there are any discrepancies from the initial scope, they will be identified and dealt with using the scope change process. 
</li>
<li>
The Fleeky Hub project's procedure for modifying its scope will entail the Project Manager submitting a request for scope change, which will then be approved by the project sponsor. It is crucial to thoroughly assess any alterations to the project's scope to ensure that they are consistent with the project's objectives and do not have a detrimental impact on the project schedule or budget. 
</li>
<li>
The project manager will ensure that all project requirements are met and that the project sponsor and other important stakeholders approve and accept the final project deliverables. The project will be considered successfully completed only after all deliverables have been accepted and any remaining issues have been addressed. 
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Schedule Management Plan</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Fleeky Hub scheduling management plan. Business success requires time management in today's fast-paced environment. To provide our goods and services on time, Fleeky Hub effectively manages our timetables.</p>
<br>The schedule management plan describes the teams methods for operating the company of fleeky curtains smoothly. The group wants to maximize production, minimize downtime, and optimize resources. This approach ensures that the group will address client needs while preserving quality and efficiency.
<br>The document will be tackling the schedule management approach, schedule control, schedule changes/thresholds, and scope change. To ensure all of the members of the group is on the same page, we will discuss our internal and customer communication processes. Since the main goal of the business is to satisfy the customers’ needs, we are dedicated to using the finest schedule management strategies to attain this aim.

<h2>Schedule Management Approach</h2>
<p>In this section of the paper, the team will be discussing what approaches the group will use in terms of managing the schedule of tasks that were previously tackled in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The team has decided that ProjectLibre will be used as our scheduling tool, due to the nature of the software being open-source and user-friendly. ProjectLibre will be used by the group to create schedules or timeframes for the group to accomplish in order to schedule all activities that relate to the project, deadlines, as well as project milestones.</p>
<br>The following are the milestones for the project schedule:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Milestone</th>
      <th>Timeframe</th>

<h1>Cost Management Plan</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In Fleeky Curtains, the management and the employees are responsible for keeping the business running. Since the client is a small business handled by family members, each of the decisions and budget planning is in the scope of the family members. The investor and the founder of Fleeky Curtains is the one who finances the business, Mitzi Garcia. She also oversees which products to be invested in and the raw materials to supplement the production of curtains. The investor also has the authority to approve the changes to the project of Fleeky Hub and carry out the budget for the business and the project.</p>
<br>On the other note, the manager Neil Albert Garcia does the administrative tasks and manages the accounting for the transactions and expenses for the business. The manager also oversees the operations. 

<h3>Cost Management Responsibilities:</h3>
<br>• The Project Manager will be responsible for overall cost management of the project and will be the primary point of contact for all cost-related issues.
<br>• The Finance Team will be responsible for monitoring project costs and ensuring that they are within the approved budget. 

<h3>Cost Change Approval:</h3>
<br>• All cost changes must be approved by the Project Manager before they are implemented.
<br>• If the cost change exceeds 10% of the total project budget, it must be approved by the Project Sponsor before it can be implemented.

<h3>Cost Measurement and Reporting:</h3>
<br>• Costs will be measured and reported monthly, using a cost performance index (CPI) and a schedule of performance index (SPI)
<br>• Reports will be presented to the Project Sponsors monthly.

<h3>Budget Format and Standards:</h3>
<br>• The Budget will be presented in a clear and concise format, using a spreadsheet format such as Excel and Fleeky Hub’s Website feature (If implemented/upon agreement)
<br>• The budget will be broken down into individual line items, with detailed cost estimates for each item.
<br>• The budget will be updated monthly, with any changes clearly highlighted.

<p>Overall, the Cost Management Plan for the Fleeky Hub project is designed to ensure that all costs associated with the project are effectively managed and controlled, so that the project can be completed within the approved budget. This will help ensure that the project is completed successfully and on time.</p>

<h2>Cost Management Approach</h2>
<h3>The Cost Management approach for the dispatch directory system project will be based on the following principles:</h3>
  
  <h3>a) Clear definitions of costs:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The project team will work closely with stakeholders to clearly define and document the cost associated with the project, including development, materials, tools, API, and other expenses that are included within the project development contract agreement.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>b) Budget development tracking:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A detailed project budget will be developed and regularly updated throughout the project, with costs tracked and reported in real time.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>c) Cost estimates:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The project team will use a variety of cost estimation techniques to ensure that the project budget is accurate and realistic.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>d) Cost variance analysis:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The project team will closely monitor costs throughout the project and perform variance analysis to identify and address any cost overruns or savings.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>e) Cost management roles and responsibilities:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear roles and responsibilities for cost management will be defined and communicated to all project team members.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>f) Approval process for changes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A formal process for approving changes to the project or its budget will be established and implemented.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>g) Reporting and communication:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Regular cost reports will be prepared and shared with stakeholders, including the project sponsor, project team, and management.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>By following these principles and practices, the project team will be able to effectively manage costs and ensure that the project stays on budget.</p>

  <h2>Measuring Project Costs</h2>
  <h3>The Cost Management Plan</h3>
<p>The Cost Management Plan for the Fleeky Hub project will include a detailed approach for measuring project cost using Earned Value Management (EVM). This will involve capturing and reporting on various Earned Value metrics, such as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) or Planned Value (PV):</strong> These measures the budgeted costs of the work that was planned to be completed at a specific point of time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV):</strong> These measures the budgeted costs of the work that has been completed at a specific point in time.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>To calculate the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) or Earned Value (EV), we need to know the percentage of work completed for each task or WBS element. Assuming that the percentage of completion for each of the Testing Phase tasks are as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Week</th>
      <th>Task</th>
      <th>Percentage of Completion</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>26</td>
      <td>Testing Phase 1</td>
      <td>100%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>27</td>
      <td>Testing Phase 2</td>
      <td>75%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>28</td>
      <td>Testing Phase 3</td>
      <td>50%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>29</td>
      <td>Testing Phase 4</td>
      <td>25%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  <strong>Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) or Actual Cost (AC):</strong> These measures the actual costs incurred for the work that has been completed at a specific point in time.
</p>

<p>
  These metrics will be used to perform cost variance analysis (CV), schedule performance index (SPI), and cost performance index (CPI) to measure the project's cost performance over time. To assist in capturing these metrics, the project team will use project management software that is capable of tracking and reporting on EVM metrics. This software will also be used to forecast future project costs and to review cost performance over time, across work packages or schedule activities.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>a. Cost Variance (CV):</strong> Measures the difference between the actual cost and the planned cost of the project. It is calculated by subtracting the actual cost from the planned cost. A negative CV indicates that the project is over budget, while a positive CV indicates that the project is under budget.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>b. Schedule Performance Index (SPI):</strong> Measures the project's schedule performance by comparing the planned schedule to the actual schedule. This index is calculated as the ratio of the BCWP to the BCWS. It is calculated by dividing the earned value by the planned value. A value of 1 indicates that the project is on schedule, while a value less than 1 indicates that the project is behind schedule, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the project is ahead of schedule.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>c. Cost Performance Index (CPI):</strong> Measures the project's cost performance by comparing the actual cost to the planned cost. This index is calculated as the ratio of the BCWP to the ACWP. It is calculated by dividing the value earned by the actual cost. A value of 1 indicates that the project is on budget, while a value less than 1 indicates that the project is over budget, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the project is under budget.
</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>
  To calculate the Cost Performance Index (CPI), we need to use the following formula:<br>
  CPI = EV / AC<br>
  where:<br>
  EV = Earned Value (BCWP)<br>
  AC = Actual Cost (ACWP)
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, the Cost Performance Index (CPI) is 4. This means that for every one peso spent, the project has earned 4 pesos in value. This indicates that the project is on budget and may continue to bring the costs sustainable within the planned budget.
</p>

<p>
  In summary, the Cost Management Plan will ensure that the project costs are effectively managed and controlled throughout the project’s lifecycle by using Earned Value Management metrics, schedule performance index, and cost performance index. These metrics will help the team to identify the areas where the project is underperforming and take corrective actions to bring the project back on track.
</p>

<h2>Cost Variance Response Process</h2>
<h3>The Cost Variance Response process for Fleeky Hub project will be as follows:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Control Thresholds:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Several control criteria for cost variation will be specified for the project.</li>
      <li>These limits will be 3%, 7%, and 10% of the project's overall budget.</li>
      <li>The project will be deemed to have a cost variance if any of these criteria are reached.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Identification of Variance:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Project Manager oversees locating any cost variations and informing the Project Sponsor about them.</li>
      <li>To find and monitor any variations, the project manager will make use of earned value metrics and other cost management tools.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Analysis of Variance:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To pinpoint the source of the issue and provide choices for remedial action, the project manager will examine the deviation.</li>
      <li>The project manager will also take into account how the deviation may affect the project's scope and timeline.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Presentation of Options:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The project manager will give the project sponsor a presentation on the possibilities for remedial action.</li>
      <li>The choices will depend on the underlying reason for the deviation and how it affects the project's scope and timeline.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Approval of Corrective Action:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>After considering the available choices, the project sponsor will decide on a course of action to get the project back on track.</li>
      <li>This can entail raising the budget, lowering the scope or quality, or taking other remedial measures.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Implementation of Corrective Action:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The project manager will put the agreed corrective action into practice and keep an eye on the outcomes.</li>
      <li>The project manager will also make the necessary updates to the budget and timeline.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Reporting:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In the monthly project status report, the project manager will note any cost variances, remedial actions performed, and their outcomes.</li>
      <li>The project manager will also give updates on the budget and timeline for the project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Throughout the course of the project, the Cost Variance Response procedure will be active. The Project Sponsor will oversee authorizing any necessary remedial steps, while the Project Manager will be in charge of monitoring and regulating the project expenditures.</p>

<h2>Cost Change Control Process</h2>

<h3>The cost change control process</h3>
<p>The cost change control process will follow the established project change request process. Approvals for project budget/cost changes must be approved by the project sponsor.</p>

<p>In Fleeky Hub, there are several processes to be followed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the change: The curtain business identifies a cost change related to the development of their website.</li>
  <li>Analyze the impact: The impact of the cost change is assessed, including its effect on project timelines, resource requirements, and budgetary constraints.</li>
  <li>Evaluate alternatives: The business considers different solutions to address the cost change, such as increasing the budget, reprioritizing features, or delaying the website launch.</li>
  <li>Obtain approval: The proposed solution is presented to the project sponsor for approval.</li>
  <li>Communicate the change: The cost change is communicated to all relevant stakeholders, including the development team, project manager, and finance department.</li>
  <li>Implement the change: The chosen solution is implemented promptly and effectively.</li>
  <li>Monitor the results: The project manager and finance department monitor the actual costs against the revised budget and track the impact of the change on the project timeline.</li>
</ol>

<p>By following this process, the curtain business can successfully manage cost changes related to the development of their website, ensuring that the project remains within budget and on schedule.</p>

<h1>Communication Management Plan</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Fleeky Curtains Project Communication Management Plan includes the methods and procedures to support successful communication among all project stakeholders. Clear and timely communication is critical for effective project implementation because it keeps everyone informed, engaged, and aligned throughout the project's lifespan.<br>

This strategy serves as a road map for creating communication channels, defining roles and duties, and delivering information in an orderly and consistent manner. By putting this strategy into action, we hope to enhance collaboration, handle problems quickly, and build a shared understanding among stakeholders.<br>

The customer, project team, management, end users, and support staff are all involved in the Fleeky Curtains project. Each stakeholder is critical to the project's success, and efficient communication among them is essential for meeting project goals.<br>

This plan's communication objectives include keeping stakeholders up to date on project progress, milestones, and timelines, facilitating collaboration and coordination among project team members, gathering feedback to address concerns, and providing a platform for sharing project knowledge and updates.<br> 

Various communication channels will be used to attain these goals. Project meetings will be held to discuss progress, resolve concerns, and plan future activities. Email will be utilized for official updates and document exchange, whilst collaboration tools and instant messaging platforms will allow for real-time cooperation and casual contact among team members. Stakeholder surveys will be undertaken on a regular basis to collect input, and status reports will be distributed to offer an overview of project achievements and forthcoming activities. In addition, as a consolidated source of project information, a dedicated project website or portal will be built.<br>

To guarantee successful communication management, roles and duties are clearly defined. The project manager will oversee managing communication operations in general, while a communication coordinator will support and coordinate communication efforts. Team members and stakeholders will communicate actively, offering updates, comments, and requesting clarification as needed.<br>

Regular reviews will be done to monitor and assess the success of the communication strategy, which will include input from stakeholders, communication logs, and project performance indicators. This will allow us to make the required modifications and enhancements to the project's communication methods.<br>

We intend to establish a collaborative atmosphere, develop effective communication, and assure the successful implementation of the Fleeky Curtains project by adopting this Communication Management Plan. We can overcome problems, align stakeholders, and provide a high-quality product that satisfies the requirements and expectations of all parties involved by communicating transparently and consistently.<br>

    <li>Feedback and Continuous Improvement: Encourage feedback from team members and stakeholders to improve communication processes and address any issues or challenges. Actively seek suggestions for enhancing communication effectiveness and implement necessary improvements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Communication Escalation Process</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Informal Resolution:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 1: Direct Communication - If there is a communication issue or conflict, individuals involved should first attempt to resolve it through direct communication. They should discuss the matter openly, actively listen to each other's perspectives, and work towards finding a mutually agreeable solution.</li>
      <li>Step 2: Team Mediation - If the issue remains unresolved, the parties involved can seek assistance from a neutral team member or a designated mediator. The mediator will facilitate a discussion to help the individuals reach a resolution and restore effective communication.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Formal Escalation:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 3: Project Manager Intervention - If the issue cannot be resolved through informal means, it should be escalated to the project manager. The project manager will assess the situation, gather relevant information, and take necessary steps to address the communication breakdown. This may involve holding a meeting with all parties involved, clarifying expectations, and finding a resolution.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Executive Intervention:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 4: Executive Involvement - In rare cases where the communication issue remains unresolved despite previous efforts, it may be necessary to involve executives or higher-level management. The executives will review the situation, consider all perspectives, and provide guidance or make final decisions to resolve the communication breakdown.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Throughout the escalation process, it is important to document all communication, steps taken, and resolutions reached. This documentation will serve as a reference for future references, ensuring transparency and accountability.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Fleeky Curtains should regularly review the communication escalation process to identify areas for improvement. Feedback from team members and stakeholders should be actively sought to enhance the effectiveness of the process and prevent similar issues in the future.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

Any concerns or questions raised by the workforce will be addressed promptly and with empathy.</p>
  
  <h4>Performance Monitoring:</h4>
  <p>The Transition Project Manager will establish performance monitoring mechanisms to ensure that employees are adapting well to the transition and meeting the required performance standards. Regular feedback sessions and performance evaluations will be conducted to provide guidance and support as needed.</p>
  
  <h4>Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:</h4>
  <p>Knowledge transfer activities will be organized to capture and document critical project information and expertise from the existing workforce. This will facilitate the smooth transfer of knowledge to the new team members and ensure the continuity of project operations.</p>
  
  <p>The workforce transition plan will be periodically reviewed and updated to align with the project timeline and requirements. Flexibility and adaptability will be key to successfully navigating the transition, ensuring that the workforce is well-prepared and motivated throughout the process.</p>
  
  <h2>Workforce Execution During Transition</h2>
  
  <p>During the transition period of the Fleeky Curtains project, several essential tasks will be carried out to ensure a smooth and successful transition. The workforce will be responsible for executing the following activities:</p>
  
  <h4>User Training:</h4>
  <p>The workforce will develop and deliver training materials to educate users on the new system. Training sessions, encompassing both classroom and hands-on training, will be conducted over a span of three days. This will enable users to understand and effectively utilize the new system.</p>
  
  <h4>Go Live:</h4>
  <p>The workforce will ensure that all systems are in place and functioning correctly before the new system is made available to users. This will involve final system testing, data migration, and validation to ensure a seamless transition and minimal disruption to operations.</p>
  
  <h4>Document Lessons Learned:</h4>
  <p>The team will document valuable insights and lessons learned during the project. This documentation will identify areas of success and areas that require improvement. By capturing these lessons, future projects can benefit from best practices and avoid potential pitfalls.</p>
  
  <h4>Update Files/Records:</h4>
  <p>The workforce will be responsible for updating all relevant files and records to reflect the completion of the project. This may involve archiving certain documents, updating contracts and agreements with new information, and ensuring that all project-related files are accurate and up to date.</p>
  
  <h4>Gain Formal Acceptance:</h4>
  <p>The team will work towards obtaining formal acceptance from the customer, indicating that the transition has been completed successfully. They will ensure that all deliverables have been met, and the customer is satisfied with the new system's functionality and performance.</p>
  
  <h4>Archive Files/Documents:</h4>
  <p>The workforce will archive all project-related files and documents to maintain a well-organized record of the project. This will include contracts, agreements, project plans, and other relevant materials, ensuring easy retrieval for future reference or audits.</p>
  
  <h4>Project Close Out Meeting:</h4>
  <p>The transition team will conduct a project close-out meeting with all stakeholders to review the overall project. This meeting will provide an opportunity to discuss successes, areas for improvement, and address any outstanding issues. It will ensure that the project is officially closed, and all parties are aligned on the project's outcomes.</p>
  
  <p>By executing these activities efficiently and effectively, the workforce will contribute to a successful transition for Fleeky Curtains, ensuring the new system's seamless integration and user satisfaction.</p>
  
  <h2>Subcontracts</h2>
  
  <p>There are no existing contracts or subcontract agreements related to this project. Therefore, no transition of contracts or related agreements is required.</p>
  
  <h2>Property Transition</h2>
  
  <h3>Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)</h3>
  <p>Since there is no involvement of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) in the Fleeky Curtains project, this section of the transition plan is not applicable. The project team does not need to consider any GFE-related matters during the transition.</p>
  
  <h3>Incumbent Owned Equipment</h3>
  <p>In the Fleeky Curtains project, it is crucial to clearly identify the equipment that is owned by the incumbent and will remain with them. If there are any equipment assets required to support the customer's applications and services, the transition plan should specify whether the new contractor or the customer has the option to purchase or utilize this equipment. The plan should also outline a timeline for the transfer of ownership and any necessary documentation, such as bills of sale or transfer of ownership agreements.</p>
  
  <p>In this project, if Fleeky Curtains has the necessary equipment to support the system, there may not be a need for the project team to transition the equipment to the new contractor. However, it is still important to clearly identify which equipment is incumbent-owned and which will be provided by Fleeky Curtains to ensure a smooth transition and prevent any potential conflicts or misunderstandings. The project team should work closely with Fleeky Curtains and the new contractor to ensure that all required equipment is available and properly transferred, if needed.</p>
  
  <p>By addressing the property transition considerations and ensuring clear communication between all parties involved, the Fleeky Curtains project can successfully navigate the transfer of equipment ownership and minimize any disruptions during the transition process.</p>
  
  <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
  
  <p>During the transition process of the Fleeky Curtains project, it is crucial to consider the handling of intellectual property (IP) to facilitate a seamless transfer of all pertinent documentation, supplier and subcontractor information, service agreements, or original designs or plans. Proper management of IP entails addressing legal considerations and may involve the completion of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) between the incumbent and the customer.</p>
  
  <p>To ensure the appropriate handling of intellectual property during the transition, the following steps will be undertaken:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Identification of Relevant Intellectual Property:</b>
  <p>All intellectual property associated with the project will be identified, encompassing design documents, patents, trademarks, copyrights, software code, and any proprietary information or trade secrets.</p>
  
  <li><b>Evaluation of Contractual Agreements:</b>
  <p>Existing contractual agreements concerning intellectual property ownership and transfer will be carefully reviewed and assessed to ensure compliance throughout the transition.</p>
  
  <li><b>Negotiation of New Agreements:</b>
  <p>If any gaps or inconsistencies are identified in the existing agreements, new agreements will be negotiated among the incumbent, new contractor, and the customer. These new agreements will aim to establish clear guidelines for the proper ownership and transfer of all intellectual property.</p>
  
  <li><b>Protection of Intellectual Property:</b>
  <p>During the transition period, all intellectual property will be safeguarded through the implementation of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and other relevant legal measures.</p>
  
  <li><b>Transfer of Intellectual Property:</b>
  <p>Upon the completion of the transition process, the transfer of relevant intellectual property will be executed according to the contractual agreements in place. This may involve transferring ownership to the new contractor, the customer, or retaining it with the incumbent, as stipulated in the agreements.</p>
 </ol>
  <p>By adhering to these steps, Fleeky Curtains can ensure a smooth and secure transition of all intellectual property associated with the project. This approach will mitigate the risk of IP-related issues and facilitate a successful transition process.</p>
  
  <h2>User Accounts and Passwords</h2>
  
  <p>As part of the transition plan for the Fleeky Curtains project, the transition of user accounts and passwords is a crucial aspect to address. The following outlines the steps and considerations for this property transition:</p>
  
  <h4>User Account Inventory:</h4>
  <p>Create a comprehensive inventory of all user accounts, including internal and external users. This inventory should specify the associated privileges and roles of each account. Identify accounts that are no longer active or necessary for the system.</p>
  
  <h4>Password Security:</h4>
  <p>Prioritize security during the transition by resetting or disabling all user passwords. Notify users to change their passwords to a temporary password provided by the transition team. Once the transition is complete, require users to create new, secure passwords to enhance system security.</p>
  
  <h4>Account Transition and Disablement:</h4>
  <p>Determine which accounts will be transitioned to the new system and which accounts should be disabled. Assign responsible individuals to oversee the transfer of accounts and passwords. Develop clear procedures for disabling accounts of terminated employees, contractors, or third-party vendors to revoke their access rights promptly.</p>
  
  <h4>Table of User Accounts:</h4>
  <p>Provide a table detailing all user accounts involved in the transition. Include the username, associated roles, and privileges. This table will act as a reference document during the transition process.</p>
  
  <h4>User Communication and Training:</h4>
  <p>Inform users about the account transition process, including any changes in login credentials and access rights. Offer training sessions or provide documentation to guide users through the new account setup and password reset procedures.</p>
  
  <p>By diligently addressing these steps, the Fleeky Curtains project can ensure a secure and well-organized transition of user accounts and passwords, safeguarding system access and maintaining data integrity.</p>

  <h2>Risk Management Plan</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Fleeky Hub aims to provide a system for Fleeky Curtains.</p>
  
  <p>The risk management plan encompasses the roles and responsibilities of the project team, the risk assessment plan, and an outline of the risk management process. It will also detail the procedures for monitoring and managing risks, as well as the tactics for responding to risks. The plan's efficacy will be evaluated based on the prompt identification and resolution of threats.</p>
  
  <h3>Information for Developing a Risk Management Plan for Fleeky Hub:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Identifying Risk: Fleeky Hub development, implementation, and operation project group ought to be aware of any potential dangers. Risks may appear from a number of different places, including technical problems, legal requirements, cybersecurity, and human factors. Risks should be identified and then evaluated for both chance of occurrence and potential effects on the project.</li>
    <li>Risk Monitoring: Risk management is an ongoing activity that needs regular observation and evaluation. To guarantee that risk management procedures are still effective, risks are updated, and new risks are discovered, the project team should establish a frequent review process. All stakeholders should be informed of any changes during the review process, which should be open and transparent.</li>
    <li>Contingency Plans: The project team needs to create backup plans for major risks that could have a big impact on the project's success. Plans for alternatives ought to specify the actions needed to lessen the risk's effects and keep the project moving forward. As the project develops and new risks are discovered, these strategies should be periodically reviewed and modified.</li>
    <li>Risk Mitigation Tactics: The project team should create a plan for minimizing or avoiding the risks after having identified and assessed the risks. Prioritizing mitigation tactics should be done in accordance with how well they reduce risk and how easily they can be implemented in terms of both time and money. Contingency planning, redundancy, risk transfer through insurance, and the creation of fallback processes are some possible strategies.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The Fleeky Hub project team will guarantee the efficient execution of the project, meeting all objectives and mitigating potential risks by incorporating additional considerations into a risk management plan.</p>
  
  <h3>Top Three Risks</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Fleeky Hub would not synchronize the data/information (new customer orders) of the user being recorded if the internet connection is disrupted and/or lost during the process.</li>
    <li>The payment is transferred/exchanged if the internet connection is lost and if there was no receipt produced by the system.</li>
    <li>The data of Fleeky Hub can be vulnerable to risks when it comes to unauthorized personnel since the customer’s personal data can be interacted by the employees.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Risk Management Approach</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Risk Identification and Assessment: Through brainstorming sessions, studies of prior project experiences, and evaluation of the project's requirements and scope, the project team will identify project-related threats. The risks will be listed in a risk register together with details about their likelihood of happening, potential effects, and description. The identified risks will be assessed in terms of their likelihood of occurring and their effect on the project's objectives and plans.</li>
    <li>Risk Response Planning: For each identified risk, the project team will develop a detailed risk response plan. The response strategies may include avoiding, transferring, mitigating, or accepting the risk. The risk response plan will outline the actions to be taken, the parties responsible for executing them, and the timeline for completion. The plan will also include provisions for monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the risk responses.</li>
    <li>Risk Monitoring and Control: The project team will establish a process for ongoing monitoring and control of risks. This will involve regular review of the risk register, tracking the progress of risk response actions, and identifying any new risks that may arise during the project. The project team will also evaluate the effectiveness of risk responses and make adjustments as necessary.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Risk Identification</h3>
  <p>During a risk assessment meeting, the project team and key stakeholders were tasked with identifying and assessing potential risks that could impact the success of the project. The identified risks were then documented in a risk registry. In order to identify additional hazards and develop mitigation strategies, the project team also examined historical data from similar projects. Additionally, experts were consulted and questioned about their experiences in developing similar systems to uncover any additional risks and devise appropriate mitigation plans.</p>
  
  <h3>Potential Risks for Fleeky Hub</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Human Error: Errors made by project team members, having the potential of having an influence on the project.</li>
    <li>Security Vulnerabilities: The initiative runs the risk of being exposed to security lapses or data loss, both of which might have dire repercussions.</li>
    <li>Unforeseen Circumstances: There is a chance that unanticipated events (such as transaction discrepancy and data processing error) could have an unexpected effect on the project.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Risk Qualification and Prioritization</h3>
  <p>The project team will regularly review and update the risk record to ensure that risks are prioritized appropriately. The risks mentioned in the risk records were classified and evaluated using a probability-impact matrix. Risks that would have a significant effect on the project and a high possibility of occurring were given top consideration. The following is an overview of the likelihood of risks and their effects on the project:</p>
  
   <h4>Extreme</h4>
  <p>Risks that could seriously harm the project and have a very high possibility of happening.</p>
  
  <h4>High</h4>
  <p>Risks that could have a big impact on the project and have a high chance of happening. The team must immediately address these risks and create mitigation plans for them.</p>
  
  <h4>Medium</h4>
  <p>Risks that have an average chance of happening and a fair impact on the project. In order to prepare for these risks, mitigation plans should be created, and these risks should be continuously monitored.</p>
  
  <h4>Low</h4>
  <p>Risks that have a small impact on the project and a low likelihood of occurring. Periodically monitoring these risks will allow for the development of mitigation plans in case they occur.</p>
  
  <h4>Negligible</h4>
  <p>Risks that have little chance of happening and little effect on the project. These dangers can be disregarded.</p>
  
  <h3>Risk Monitoring</h3>
  <p>The Fleeky Hub Agile Risk Management Plan offers a framework for actively tracking risks throughout the project. To do this, it is crucial to closely document the process, including defining the circumstances that might trigger risks, and to regularly monitor risks during the course of the project.</p>
  
  <p>The high-scoring risks will be incorporated into the project schedule, and the risk manager will be given responsibility for their monitoring. This will make it easier for the project manager to decide when hazards need to be closely monitored and when the risk manager should provide project team meetings with updates. The risk manager will be in charge of monitoring the risk trigger circumstances. The project manager will also make sure that the project team is informed of the risks that have been identified and their potential effects on the project. Any new risks or modifications to existing risks should be reported to the risk management by the project team so that they can be evaluated and given the appropriate level of priority.</p>
  
  <p>The agile risk management methodology, which emphasizes flexibility and constant improvement, will be used by the project team. To guarantee that the project's goals and quality standards are met, the effectiveness of the risk management plan will be periodically evaluated and changed as necessary.</p>
  
  <h3>Risk Mitigation and Avoidance</h3>
  <p>The project team will develop the risk management plan based on the value that each risk is given. The first stage in risk mitigation and avoidance is to identify and prioritize the potential risks. Strategies to prepare for likely delays could include preparing backup plans, allocating more resources, or changing project deadlines. The project team should determine which risks have the highest likelihood and potential impact and then establish plans to reduce or eliminate those risks. The project manager has the following main factors and choices to think about:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Resource Allocation: The project manager must make sure the team has the necessary resources, including competence, abilities, and expertise, as well as access to tools and equipment, in order for the project to be effective and efficient.</li>
    <li>Risk Assessment: To effectively estimate and handle potential hazards, the team should do a detailed analysis of them. Early in the project, the risk assessment should be finished, and the project manager should move quickly to identify and reduce any potential risks.</li>
    <li>Contingency Planning: The project team must develop backup plans for emergencies in order to be ready for potential dangers.</li>
    <li>Agile Approach: Risk management can be done in a flexible and quick manner by using the Agile methodology.</li>
    <li>Communication: The project manager must encourage open and transparent communication between the project team, clients, and stakeholders to reduce risks and avoid misunderstandings.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Risk Register</h3>
  <p>Each risk, its likelihood, potential repercussions, and any mitigation steps will be fully explained in the risk register, which will be maintained current throughout the project. The risk register will be reviewed and updated frequently to make sure it accurately reflects the state of the project at the present time. The risk registry, which will be stored in a central location, will be accessible to all stakeholders.</p>
  
  <p>This risk management strategy is often in line with the Agile methodology and places an emphasis on early and frequent risk discovery, collaborative risk management, and continuing risk monitoring. The risk register will be based on the following standards:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Risk ID - Each risk will receive a special identification number.</li>
    <li>Risk Description - The risk event will be clearly and concisely described.</li>
    <li>Risk Category - Risks will be categorized as technical, organizational, or legal.</li>
    <li>Risk Owner - Will be in charge of keeping an eye on and managing every risk.</li>
    <li>Probability - On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 denoting the lowest chance and 5 denoting the highest, the likelihood of a risk occurring is evaluated.</li>
    <li>Impact - On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents the least significant impact and 5 represents the most significant impact, the risk's potential impact on the project is evaluated.</li>
    <li>Risk Score - For the purpose of calculating the overall risk score, the likelihood and impact scores are compounded.</li>
    <li>Mitigation Strategy - Explains the precise steps that must be done to reduce the risk.</li>
    <li>Status - The current state of the risk, including whether it is open, ongoing, or closed, is also recorded.</li>
    <li>Target Resolution Date - Predicted day that the risk will be resolved.</li>
