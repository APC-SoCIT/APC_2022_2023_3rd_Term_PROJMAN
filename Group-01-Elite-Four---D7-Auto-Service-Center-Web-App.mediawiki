=4. BUSINESS CASE=
==4.1 Executive Summary==
The D7 Auto Service Center, an established participant in the automotive business, is having difficulties using the existing advertising strategies to promote its services and build an online presence. Furthermore, the lack of a centralized system makes reservation management difficult and frustrating, leading to inconsistent booking practices. A web-app project is suggested as a solution to these problems in order to centralize reservations and bookings in a digital system. A reservation system, customer profiles, service galleries, reviews/feedback area, social media links, and other features will all be included in the online application. The project will adhere to the Agile development technique, considering suggestions from D7's management and clients at every stage. Results including better reservation management, higher visibility, and improved customer service are anticipated. The solution can be supported by the fact that it will allow D7 to serve consumers around the clock, organize bookings, and provide a comfortable communication platform. The project overview gives information on the project description, goals, objectives, and milestones, while the problem statement underlines the difficulties D7 is now facing. 

In conclusion, the D7 Auto Service Center web-app project is suggested as a thorough solution to deal with the company's issues with advertising, online presence, and reservation management, with projected favorable consequences and alignment with SDG no. 9 on Innovation.

===4.1.1 Issue===
The D7 Auto Service Center is a well-established enterprise in the automobile industry, having served customers in Cavite, Philippines for over 16 years. Despite its long-standing presence in the market, D7 has encountered challenges in effectively promoting its services and establishing an online presence using its current advertising methods. Furthermore, the company faces difficulties in managing reservations due to the absence of a centralized system, resulting in inconsistencies and errors in recordkeeping. As a consequence, retrieving information when necessary has become inconvenient.

===4.1.2 Anticipated Outcomes===
After the deployment of the Web-app developed for D7 Auto Service Center as an additional platform, the D7 Auto Service Center will now have an additional platform to aid in advertising their services, which also gives them increased visibility, given as an advantage amongst their competitors and to have a centralized system. Furthermore, this platform will allow a more centralized and available 24/7 reservation system and management of the reservation system, while it also extends D7’s support to their customers and potential clients.

===4.1.3 Recommendation===
The proposed solution recommended by the project team is to develop a comprehensive Web-App that centralizes all reservations and bookings into a digital system. This platform will facilitate convenient communication between customers and technical specialists, extending support to both existing customers and potential clients. It is anticipated that the deployment of the D7 Web-App will result in a 50% increase in customer reach within the first three months, leveraging the platform's features and functionalities.

===4.1.4 Justification===
Integrating the new Web-App project with the existing system of D7 Auto Service Center will enable the business to expand its customer base and improve service delivery. This is in contrast to the current manual and labor-intensive system. The Web-App project will centralize and automate the booking and reservation process, allowing the business to serve customers round-the-clock while providing a unified platform for communication between customers and technical specialists. This will take progress of lessening to eliminating unnecessary complexities in communication, unlike the previous system with multiple contact channels. The addition of the Web-App platform will not replace the existing system, but rather enhance it by extending its capabilities and providing a more efficient and convenient customer experience.

==4.3. Problem Definition==
===4.3.1 Problem Statement===
The D7 Auto Service Center is facing multiple challenges in their business operations. Firstly, their current advertising and online presence on Facebook, their sole platform for promotions, is struggling due to limitations in customer reach caused by the platform's ever-changing algorithm. This hinders their ability to effectively promote their services and engage with potential customers, especially in a highly competitive online market.

Secondly, D7 Auto Service Center is facing difficulties in managing and keeping track of customer reservations. Customers use various channels such as Gmail, mobile text, Facebook Messenger, and walk-ins to make reservations, resulting in a lack of centralized system for recording and managing bookings. This leads to inconsistencies, errors, and time-consuming manual collation of data from different channels, which affects their customer service and revenue potential.

Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the online competition for D7 Auto Service Center, making it even more challenging to attract and retain customers. They need innovative solutions to improve their online presence, customer engagement, and reservation management to stay competitive in the market and enhance their overall business performance

These challenges highlight the need for a comprehensive solution that can address D7 Auto Service Center's advertising and online presence issues, streamline their reservation management process, and provide additional features to enhance customer engagement

===4.3.2 Issue===
The proposed project at D7 Auto Service Center will make significant improvements to organizational processes, tools, hardware, and software.

Additionally, the project will provide an extended communication platform for customers and specialists through the web-app, allowing for seamless and efficient communication for inquiries, clarifications, and updates. This will lead to increased customer engagement and satisfaction and improved communication within the organization for more effective service delivery. The project may also create new roles or modify existing ones to align with the new system, such as assigning a designated team or individual to manage and oversee reservations. Overall, the proposed project will bring about positive changes in reservation management and customer interactions within the organization. 

===4.3.3 Technology Mitigation===
D7 Auto Service Center will have an implemented customized software solution designed for their business, involving configuration of the software to meet their unique needs and close collaboration with the project team for smooth deployment and integration. Future data collected upon usage of the web-app including customer profiles, service history, inventory records, and financial transactions, will be uploaded to the new system, validated for accuracy and integrity, and converted into compatible formats.

=7. SCOPE MANAGEMENT PLAN=

==7.1 Introduction==

Throughout the D7 Auto Service Center Web-App life cycle, the scope of the work will be defined, validated, regulated, and verified according to the guidelines in the scope management plan. The scope management plan’s goal is to guarantee that the project stays on course and fulfills its intended scope within the set timetable and budget. 

To create the scope management plan for the D7 Auto Service Center, the team will apply the five-step process of Project Scope Management, which includes collecting requirements, defining scope, creating a WBS (Work Breakdown Structure), verifying scope, and controlling scope.

1) Collect Requirements - The team will be defining and documenting the requirements necessary to achieve the project objectives. Both the project charter and stakeholder registration will serve as the foundation for the collection of requirements, which will also enable the team to define requirements, discuss details associated with achieving each requirement, and clarify them through interviews and follow-up discussions. To ensure that the project's execution phase can measure the requirements, they will be meticulously recorded. As part of establishing the project scope, the documentation produced during this step will also be used as input.

2) Define Scope and User Stories – Based on the requirements gathered in the collection process, the project scope is defined in detail. This process includes creating the scope statement, developing the project charter, and identifying the deliverables and requirements for each work deliverable.

3) Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) - With the help of a WBS, the project scope is segmented into smaller, more manageable work packages. This is utilized to facilitate the project team's ability to effectively manage the project by breaking down the scope into comprehensible components. The resulting WBS visually represents the scope of the project and makes it more accessible to all team members.


4) Verify Scope - In this step, the project deliverables are examined and validated to make sure they adhere to the specifications outlined in the project scope statement. This step helps ensure that the project progresses according to schedule and that the project deliverables satisfy stakeholders' demands.

5) Control Scope - Throughout the project's lifecycle, this phase requires monitoring and regulating changes to the project's scope. This includes the team handling scope adjustments and any scope creep that might happen while the project is being carried out.

==7.2 Scope Management Approach ==

The Scope Management Approach for the project is the following:

1. Authority and Responsibility for Scope Management: The Project Manager, Andre O. Viernes, has the primary authority and responsibility for scope management, while the Project Sponsor, Anne Sydney Simpelo, will provide support and guidance as needed to complete the project within its given scope and period throughout the team’s PBL (Project Based Learning) journey. 


2. Scope Definition: To accurately define the project scope of the project, the Elite Four team will use several documents to define this matter, and these are but might not be limited to: the Scope Statement, Statement of Work, Work Breakdown Structure, WBS Dictionary, and other relevant materials that will provide a detailed understanding of the project's scope, its objectives, requirements, and deliverables.

3. Scope Measurement and Verification: To clearly identify the project’s measurement and verification it will be measured through the following:

* Success Criteria –These criteria will be used to determine if the scope of work is within line and to also measure the project's completion within its scope.
* Project Sponsor Approval – The pivotal approval of the project sponsor of the project will be the means of verification whether the project being developed was not any less nor exceeded its scope as intended within the premises of the project sponsor’s recommendations, approval, and restrictions. 

4. Scope Change Process: The project manager, Andre O. Viernes, as well as all the other team members, have the authority to change the project's scope as much as necessary, and accordingly. However, before making any modifications by any means, the project manager together with the team will consider the possible impacts on the project's schedule, budget, and other factors and will request permission from the project sponsor, Ms. Anne Sydney Simpelo to push through any changes that will be made to the project.

5. Acceptance of Final Project Deliverable(s): The final project deliverable must be accepted, and the project scope must be approved by the project sponsor, Anne Sydney Simpelo. Andre O. Viernes, the project manager, will ensure that all project deliverables have been completed in line with the scope statement and that the Project Sponsor is fully notified of any changes made throughout the project. To guarantee that all project deliverables fulfill the acceptance criteria and receive final approval, the project manager will also collaborate closely with the project sponsor.

==8.3 Measuring Project Costs==
The Measuring of the Project Costs Plan for the D7 Auto Service Web-App will include and detailed and calculated approach for the measurement of the projected project costs using EVM (Earned Value Management). This will involve and need various Earned Value metrics like:  

The BCWS (Budget Cost of Work Schedule) or PV (Planned Value)  

Measures the costs of the work that is budgeted and that is planned to be completed at a specific point in time. This is needed and required for the computation SPI (Schedule Performance Index).  

Example computations:  

To calculate the BCWS (Budget Cost of Work Schedule) or PV (Planned Value), we need to multiply the planned percentage of the completed work by the project budget, and you will get the Planned Value.  

Planned Value (PV) = (Planned % Completed) X (Project Budget)  
Planned Value (PV) = 30% X (PHP 100,000)  
      = 0.3 X (PHP 100,000)  
      = PHP 30,000  

Therefore, the project’s Planned Value (PV) is PHP 30,000.  

Reference: ​[1]​  

BCWP (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed) or EV (Earned Value)  

Measures the budgeted costs of the work that has been completed at a specific point in time. This is needed and required for the computation of SPI (Schedule Performance Index) and the CPI (Costs Performance Index).  

Example computations:  

To calculate the BCWP (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed) or EV (Earned Value), we need to multiply the Actual percentage of the completed work and multiply it by the project budget.  

Earned Value (EV) = % of Completed Work X (Project Budget)  
Earned Value (EV) = 40% X (PHP 100,000)  
 = 0.4 X (PHP 100,000) 
 = PHP 40,000  

Therefore, the project’s Earned Value (EV) is PHP 40,000.  

Reference: ​[1]​  

ACWP (Actual Cost of Work Performed) or AC (Actual Cost)  

Measures the actual costs incurred for the works that have already been completed at a specific point in time and schedule. This is needed for the computation of CV (Cost Variance) and CPI (Cost performance index)  

Example computations:  

The Actual Cost is the amount of money that has been spent so far.  
For example, if PHP 70,000 has been spent so far; Hence, the project’s Actual Cost (AC) is PHP 70,000.  

Reference: ​[1]​  

The metrics above will be used to perform Costs Variance Analysis (CV), Schedule Performance Index (SPI), and lastly the Cost Performance Index (CPI) to measure the project’s cost performance throughout the project lifecycle.   

To help with capturing and recording these metrics, the team will use various project management software that can track, record, and generate reports on these EVM metrics overtime or in real-time. The software must also be capable of making future forecasts of the project costs as it will be used to review costs performance overtime, across work packages or schedule activities.   

Cost Variance (CV)  

Measures the difference between the actual costs of the project and the planned costs. This is calculated by subtracting the actual costs from the Actual costs (EV – AC).  

Example computations:  

To calculate the Cost Variance (CV), we need to subtract the Actual Cost (AC) from the Earned Value (EV).  

Cost Variance (CV) = Earned Value (EV) - Actual Cost (AC)  
Cost Variance (CV) = PHP 40,000 – PHP 70,000  
        = PHP -30,000  

The project’s Cost Variance (CV) is PHP –30,000, and since it is negative, we are over budget.  

Reference: ​[2]​  

Schedule Performance Index (SPI)  

Measures the project's schedule performance ratio by calculating the planned schedule and comparing it to the actual schedule. The ratio is calculated by dividing the EV to the PV. The ratio that will be resulted will be compared, If it is a value of 1 this will indicate that the project is on schedule, while the ratio that will be resulted in a value that is less than 1 indicates that the schedule is behind, While a value that is over 1 show that the project is ahead of schedule.  

Example computations:  

The formula to calculate the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is given below:  

Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = Earned Value (EV) / Planned Value (PV)  
Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = PHP 40,000 / PHP 30,000  
     = 1.333  

Since the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is above 1, the project is ahead of schedule.  

Reference: ​[3]​

Cost Performance Index (CPI)  

Measures the project’s cost performance by calculating the actual costs to the planned costs of the project. This Index is calculated using this formula (CPI = EV / AC). Like the SPI the CPI also uses ratio in determining if the project is over budget, under budget, or right in budget.   

Example computations:  

The formula to calculate the Cost Performance Index (CPI) is given below:  

Cost Performance Index (CPI) = Earned Value (EV) / Actual Cost (AC)  
Cost Performance Index (CPI) = PHP 40,000 / PHP 70,000  
  = 0.571  

Since the Cost Performance Index (CPI) is less than one, the project is over budget. 

Reference: ​[3]​  

The Cost Management Plan makes sure the project costs are as effectively managed and controlled as possible throughout its project’s lifecycle. By utilizing EVM metrics and calculations. These metrics and calculations help in getting insight and identifying the areas where the project performance health is. And if the project is underperforming it will show it to the project team for them to take appropriate actions on fixing it and bring the project right on schedule and track.  

==8.4 Reporting Format==
The reporting format that would be best suited for the cost management plan of the D7 Auto Service Web-App should be a detailed and comprehensive spreadsheet or table, preferably in Microsoft Excel or something similar. Detailing the relevant cost information like project budget, actual cost, projected costs, and any variances or discrepancies and any relevant information should be included in this format. 

The format should be easy to understand and be accessible to all stakeholders, the project team, and the project management. 

Additionally, the format should include the following in its element for the cost management plan for the D7 Auto Service Web-App. 

1.	Executive Summary

This is an overall overview of the cost management plan, including the project budget that has been approved, cost variance or possible issues, and possible actions to take in order to correct the problem or take corrective actions towards solving them.

2.	Budget Overview

This part explains the rational of the budget and explains them in a detailed breakdown, and the project total costs and the costs of each of the project phases or deliverables, and the possible or associated costs to the project resource.

3.	Cost Variance Analysis

Analysis of the variances of the project costs between of the budgeted costs. With in-depth explanation and breakdown of the variances between them, the possible impact of them on the project, and possible actions to take to address them. 

4.	Budget Forecast

A forecast of future project costs, potential variances, and the potential impact of them on the project. And rationale and explanation about the reasons about the possible change in the forecasts of the projected budget costs.

5.	Cost Management Metrics

This provides insight of the project’s cost performance, cost variances, and performance indexes and schedule performance indexes. Using key performance indicators as proof.



6.	Approval and Sign-off

This is where the project stakeholders and project manager review, approve and sign-off costs management plan in the documentation. 

7.	Appendices

This section is for the supporting and additional documentation and materials, related to the project, such as costs breakdown, invoices, meeting recordings, and forms.

It is important that this is a general outline, and the reporting format may change and vary depending on the specific needs of the project and organization. The additional changes should provide a comprehensive overview of the project’s cost management in order for the people involved in the project to make a informed decision and take appropriate actions. 	

==8.5 Cost Variance Response Process==
The Control Threshold for this project is a CPI or SPI of less than 0.8 or greater than 1.2.  If the project reaches one of these Control Thresholds, a Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan is required. The Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with options for corrective actions within five business days from when the cost variance is first reported. Within three business days of the Project Sponsor selecting a corrective action option, the Project Manager will present the Project Sponsor with a formal Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan. The Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan will detail the actions necessary to bring the project back within budget and how the effectiveness of the actions in the plan will be measured. Upon acceptance of the Cost Variance Corrective Action Plan, it will become part of the project plan and be updated to reflect the corrective actions.

==8.6 Cost Change Control Process ==
The cost change control process will follow the established project change request process.  Approvals for project budget/cost changes must be approved by the project sponsor and stakeholders.

1.	Identification of cost change:

The proposed change in the costs and project budget must be properly identified and documented.


2.	Analysis of the cost change:

The proposed change of the costs must be properly analyzed by the project team, reviewed by the project sponsor, and approved by all the stakeholders. As to determine whether or not to approve the cost change.

3.	Approval of the cost change

The cost change will only undergo approval after it has been thoroughly reviewed and analyzed by the project sponsor and team and has been properly documented.

4.	Implementation of the cost change

Once the cost change for the budget has been reviewed and approved it will be implemented according to the project schedule and the newly approved budget

5.	Tracking and monitoring of the cost change

The team will track and monitor closely the project to ensure that the newly approved cost change will be spent according only to the project schedule and the agreement on the cost change. And also, to ensure that the project stays on track and no more additional expenditure and cost changes are needed. 

6.	Reporting on the cost change

The cost change or any updates regarding it will be reported at each meeting of the project team, along with any relevant information surrounding the meeting and its agenda for the day to make sure nothing in the project is shrouded in uncertainty. 

This process or steps will be implemented to the cost change to make sure that the proposed changes in the budget or costs are properly rationalized and identified and approved by each stakeholder of the project.

==8.7 Project Budget==
The budget for the D7 Auto Service Center Web-App project is detailed below:

The approved budget: ₱2,820,000

The project’s duration is 331 days from Planning to Turn Over. Planning, however, will be excluded, since the project will begin after client has confirmed.

=9. SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLAN=

==9.1 Introduction==
The Elite Four's Schedule Management Plan was created during the project's planning phase and is progressing throughout the last phase. This plan serves as a roadmap for the project's execution and outlines the approach for managing the project schedule from start to finish throughout the project lifecycle. The plan establishes guidance and expectations for project schedule policies and procedures related to planning, development, management, implementation, and monitoring throughout the project lifecycle.

==9.2 Schedule Management Approach==
The Elite Four’s Project Schedule – Gantt Chart was created using Project Libre beginning with the deliverables as identified in its Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The team will be following the Project-Based Learning (PBL) approach. It is an instructional approach where students learn by actively engaging in real-world and personally meaningful projects. In PBL, students collaborate with their peers, apply critical thinking skills, and solve complex problems while developing knowledge and skills. PBL is often used in educational settings to promote deeper learning and help students develop 21st-century competencies such as creativity, collaboration, communication, and critical thinking. The team will be utilizing Agile methodology, and any necessary changes will be made as required. The project is composed of five phases, starting from planning until the maintenance phase. 
<br><br>
The project schedule milestones are identified as follows:
<br><br>
Planning
<br>
- The Planning Phase is the initial phase of the project where the team prepares for identifying the requirements, estimating resources and timeline of the project, and defining the scope, objectives, and deliverables.
<br><br>
• Preparations
<br>
• Midterm Paper
<br>
• Sprint I Works
<br>
• Paper Revisions
<br>
• Final Paper
<br>
• Sprint II Works
<br><br>
Analysis & Design
<br>
- Analysis & Design phase, where the team creates a detailed plan for the project. The phase mainly focuses on developing the project's technical requirements and detailed specifications.
<br><br>
• Preparations
<br>
• Event Table & Diagrams
<br>
• Sprint III Works
<br>
• Sprint IV Works
<br>
• Sprint V Works
<br>
• Final Requirements
<br><br>
Development
<br>
- In this phase where the actual development of the project begins, the team produces the deliverables accordingly.
<br><br>
• Preparations
<br>
• Charts
<br><br>
Deployment
<br>
- The Maintenance phase is the final phase of the project, where the team ensures that the deliverables continuously meet the required quality standard. This also involves monitoring and maintaining the project's deliverables.
<br><br>
• Documentations
<br>
• Web hosting
<br>
• Cost breakdown
<br><br>
The roles and responsibilities of Elite Four’s schedule development are as follows:
<br><br>
• The Project manager and team leader are responsible for facilitating the definition of work packages, sequencing tasks, and estimating the required duration and resources with project members. They will also create the project schedule using Project Libre and validate it with the Elite Four team, stakeholders, and the project sponsor. Subsequently, the project manager will obtain schedule approval from the project sponsor and baseline the schedule.
<br><br>
• The Project team – Elite Four team – will be in charge of cooperating and collaborating in work package definition, sequencing, and estimating resource requirements and duration. Additionally, the project members will review and validate the proposed schedule and subsequently perform assigned tasks once the schedule is approved.
<br><br>
• The Project sponsor will also participate in reviews of the proposed schedule and approve the final schedule before it is baselined.  

==9.3 Schedule Control==
The project schedule will be reviewed and updated accordingly, with actual start and finish dates and completion progress provided by team members and supervised by the project manager.

The project manager – Andre Viernes, is in charge of holding weekly scheduled updates/reviews. He will also determine the effects of schedule variances, request changes to the schedule and communicate the status of the schedule according to the project’s communication plan.

The project team – Elite Four members, are responsible for cooperating in weekly scheduled updates/reviews and will communicate to any changes from actual start/finish dates to the project manager and participating in schedule variance resolution activities as needed.

The project sponsor – Ms. Anne Sydney Simpelo, will remain informed of the project schedule’s status and will be reviewing and approving all schedule change requests which are submitted by the project manager.

==9.4 Schedule Changes and Thresholds==
The team can effectively manage and evaluate any proposed schedule changes, ensuring that they do not negatively impact the project's scope, schedule, or resources by following the process below:

1. If any of the Elite Four team members identifies a need for a schedule change, they should notify the project manager.

2. The project manager and the team will hold a meeting to review and evaluate the proposed changes.

3. During the evaluation, the team will determine the affected tasks and any variances that may result from the potential change.

4. The team will consider alternatives or actions that may be taken to address and evaluate how they may impact the scope, schedule, and resources.

5. After the evaluation, if the project manager concludes any proposed changes will exceed the established boundary condition, a schedule change request must be submitted.

==9.5 Scope Change==
If any changes are made to the project’s scope, rest assured it is approved by the project sponsor. The project manager must evaluate the scope change's impact on the current schedule. If the project manager determines that the change will significantly affect the current project schedule, they may request a re-baselining of the schedule to reflect any necessary adjustments due to the new project scope. This request must be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor before the schedule can be re-baselined.
