With a commitment to quality customer service and a team of expert technicians, D7 Auto Service Center is a reliable choice for car owners in the area.

=4. BUSINESS CASE=
==4.1 Executive Summary==
The D7 Auto Service Center, an established participant in the automotive business, is having difficulties using the existing advertising strategies to promote its services and build an online presence. Furthermore, the lack of a centralized system makes reservation management difficult and frustrating, leading to inconsistent booking practices. A web-app project is suggested as a solution to these problems in order to centralize reservations and bookings in a digital system. A reservation system, customer profiles, service galleries, reviews/feedback area, social media links, and other features will all be included in the online application. The project will adhere to the Agile development technique, considering suggestions from D7's management and clients at every stage. Results including better reservation management, higher visibility, and improved customer service are anticipated. The solution can be supported by the fact that it will allow D7 to serve consumers around the clock, organize bookings, and provide a comfortable communication platform. The project overview gives information on the project description, goals, objectives, and milestones, while the problem statement underlines the difficulties D7 is now facing.  

In conclusion, the D7 Auto Service Center web-app project is suggested as a thorough solution to deal with the company's issues with advertising, online presence, and reservation management, with projected favorable consequences and alignment with SDG no. 9 on Innovation. 

===4.1.1 Issue===
The D7 Auto Service Center is a well-established enterprise in the automobile industry, having served customers in Cavite, Philippines for over 16 years. Despite its long-standing presence in the market, D7 has encountered challenges in effectively promoting its services and establishing an online presence using its current advertising methods. Furthermore, the company faces difficulties in managing reservations due to the absence of a centralized system, resulting in inconsistencies and errors in recordkeeping. As a consequence, retrieving information when necessary has become inconvenient. 

===4.1.2 Anticipated Outcomes===
After the deployment of the Web-app developed for D7 Auto Service Center as an additional platform, the D7 Auto Service Center will now have an additional platform to aid in advertising their services, which also gives them increased visibility, given as an advantage amongst their competitors and to have a centralized system. Furthermore, this platform will allow a more centralized and available 24/7 reservation system and management of the reservation system, while it also extends D7’s support to their customers and potential clients.  

===4.1.3 Recommendation===
The proposed solution recommended by the project team is to develop a comprehensive Web-App that centralizes all reservations and bookings into a digital system. This platform will facilitate convenient communication between customers and technical specialists, extending support to both existing customers and potential clients. It is anticipated that the deployment of the D7 Web-App will result in a 50% increase in customer reach within the first three months, leveraging the platform's features and functionalities. 

===4.1.4 Justification===
Integrating the new Web-App project with the existing system of D7 Auto Service Center will enable the business to expand its customer base and improve service delivery. This is in contrast to the current manual and labor-intensive system. The Web-App project will centralize and automate the booking and reservation process, allowing the business to serve customers round-the-clock while providing a unified platform for communication between customers and technical specialists. This will take progress of lessening to eliminating unnecessary complexities in communication, unlike the previous system with multiple contact channels. The addition of the Web-App platform will not replace the existing system, but rather enhance it by extending its capabilities and providing a more efficient and convenient customer experience.

==4.6 Cost Benefit Analysis==
The Cost Benefit Analysis of the project was determined through four parts those being: 

Costs Determined:  

The only cost (as of PROJMAN) determined for this project will be that of its deployment in AWS. It is calculated to be at a total of 3$ per month, and the calculation is as follows: 

Estimated at 3$ x 12 months = 36$  

36$ converted to Philippine Peso = 1,981 Pesos. 

1,981 Pesos will be the cost of the project's launch, annually.  

Calculated/Estimated Benefits: 

Under the researched information for the objectives, it is stated that the increase in sales after deploying the additional platform (web-app) can rise to 50%. Within the first three months of deployment. Due to confidentialities with regards to the current earnings of D7 Auto Service Center, it is hereby backed up instead with the information provided to the Elite Four, in which as per the interview with the client, one service rendered, is enough to pay for the annual hosting of the web-app.  

Alternatives: 

The alternative idea for the CBA of this project, is to have it deployed in a web hosting service provider with much wider time of free hosting, and more benefits; but the Elite Four is yet to find a better alternative hosting service provider than that of AWS.  

Report and Plan Action:  

Once settled and approved of, with regards to the costing that will be rendered for the web-hosting services, the Elite Four with immediacy will upload the project to AWS for it to be launched and announced for the business accordingly. Reports and receipts will also be delivered to D7 Auto Service Center so it may be liquidated correspondingly.  
==4.7 Alternative Analysis==
The alternatives analysis was focused on providing an alternative solution for the webhosting of the project, and it is determined to have Microsoft Azure as a host alternative in case of the following:  

* The web-application is not suitable to be implemented in the AWS platform.  

* The web-application has difficulties, and many concerns when to be or when hosted via AWS.  

* The client and/or the stakeholders of the project decide to proceed with the alternative as decided.

The scope management plan’s goal is to guarantee that the project stays on course and fulfills its intended scope within the set timetable and budget.  

 
To create the scope management plan for the D7 Auto Service Center, the team will apply the five-step process of Project Scope Management, which includes collecting requirements, defining scope, creating a WBS (Work Breakdown Structure), verifying scope, and controlling scope. 

 

Collect Requirements - The team will be defining and documenting the requirements necessary to achieve the project objectives. Both the project charter and stakeholder registration will serve as the foundation for the collection of requirements, which will also enable the team to define requirements, discuss details associated with achieving each requirement, and clarify them through interviews and follow-up discussions. To ensure that the project's execution phase can measure the requirements, they will be meticulously recorded. As part of the process of establishing the project scope, the documentation produced during this step will also be used as input. 
 

Define Scope and User Stories – Based on the requirements gathered in the collection process, the project scope is defined in detail. This process includes creating the scope statement, developing the project charter, and identifying the deliverables and requirements for each work deliverable. 
 

Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) - With the help of a WBS, the project scope is segmented into smaller, more manageable work packages. This is utilized to facilitate the project team's ability to effectively manage the project by breaking down the scope into comprehensible components. The resulting WBS visually represents the scope of the project and makes it more accessible to all team members. 

 

Verify Scope - In this step, the project deliverables are examined and validated to make sure they adhere to the specifications outlined in the project scope statement. This step helps ensure that the project progresses according to schedule and that the project deliverables satisfy stakeholders' demands. 

 

Control Scope - Throughout the project's lifecycle, this phase requires monitoring and regulating changes to the project's scope. This includes the team handling scope adjustments and any scope creep that might happen while the project is being carried out.

==10.1 Introduction==
The Work Breakdown Structure presented here represents all the work required to complete this project. It will be the initial version of the web-app and it shall go under version 1. This version will undergo the PBL (Project Based Learning) phases from planning to deployment. It is hereby outlined with the help of this project management tool that will aim to provide better division of work during each respective phase. The project has divided the work accordingly per sprint to have them assigned and accomplished by the Elite Four team.
